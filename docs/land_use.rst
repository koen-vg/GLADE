Land Use & Resource Classes
============================

Overview
--------

The land use module manages agricultural land allocation across the global food system. It translates high-resolution gridded data (0.05° × 0.05°, approximately 5.6 km at the equator) into optimization variables that balance:

- **Cropland** for producing grains, oilseeds, fruits, and other crops
- **Pasture** for grassland-based livestock feed
- **Spared land** that can be taken out of production for carbon sequestration

The module uses a dual-pool structure that separates cropland and pasture, enabling independent control over land allocation and expansion for each use type.

Land Pool Structure
-------------------

The model uses separate **land pools** for cropland and pasture, with distinct supply pathways and the option to spare land for carbon sequestration:

Cropland Pool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bus pattern:** ``land:cropland:{region}_c{class}_{water}``

The cropland pool serves all crop production. Each pool is specific to a region, resource class, and water supply (rainfed or irrigated). Supply comes from:

- **Existing cropland baseline** (green arrows): Land currently in agricultural use, available without land-use-change emissions
- **New land conversion** (yellow arrows): Expansion onto previously non-agricultural land, incurring LUC emissions

Pasture Pool
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bus pattern:** ``land:pasture:{region}_c{class}``

The pasture pool serves grassland production for ruminant feed. Pasture pools are water-agnostic (no irrigated/rainfed distinction). Supply comes from:

- **Existing cropland**: Baseline agricultural land diverted to pasture use
- **New land conversion**: Expansion with LUC emissions
- **Current cropland-suitable grassland**: Existing grassland on land suitable for crops (GAEZ)
- **Current marginal grassland**: Existing grazing-only grassland that is not suitable for crops

Spared Land
~~~~~~~~~~~

Both existing cropland and both current grassland pools can be **spared**—taken out of production to earn carbon sequestration credits from vegetation regrowth:

- ``spare_land`` links: Spare existing cropland (purple dashed arrows)
- ``spare_existing_grassland`` links: Spare existing grassland

This enables the model to evaluate trade-offs between agricultural production and carbon sequestration. See :ref:`luc-emissions` for how land-use-change emissions are calculated, and :ref:`luc-spared-land-filtering` for details on sequestration credit eligibility.

Validation Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For validation scenarios, new land supply can be disabled independently:

- ``validation.disable_new_cropland``: Prevents new land from supplying cropland pools
- ``validation.disable_new_pasture``: Prevents new land from supplying pasture pools
- ``validation.disable_spared_cropland``: Prevents baseline cropland from being spared
- ``validation.disable_spared_grassland``: Prevents existing grassland pools from being spared

This allows validating against historical production patterns without spurious land-use-change from the optimizer reallocating land.

Spatial Resolution
------------------

The model operates at sub-national regional resolution, balancing spatial detail with computational tractability.

Regional Clustering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optimization regions are created by clustering administrative units (GADM level 1),
basin-aware so that hydrological scarcity is not averaged away:

1. **Simplification**: Simplify GADM geometries to reduce complexity while preserving boundaries
2. **Country selection**: Filter to configured countries (``countries`` list in config)
3. **Basin split**: Overlay provinces with the AWARE hydrological basins, giving one piece per
   (province, basin), so a province straddling an abundant and a scarce basin can be separated
4. **Clustering**: Per country, allocate a region budget by area and partition into exactly
   ``target_count`` regions, balancing geography and basin scarcity. Every region is either
   contained in one province (large provinces are split into sub-regions) or a union of whole
   provinces (small provinces are merged) -- never a mix of partial pieces across provinces, so
   regions stay comparable to political units
5. **Output**: GeoJSON with region polygons (``processing/{name}/regions.geojson``)

Key configuration parameters:

- ``aggregation.regions.target_count``: Number of regions to create (default 750)
- ``aggregation.regions.basin_scarcity_weight``: Influence of AWARE basin scarcity relative to geography when partitioning a country (default 2.0; 0 recovers plain geographic clustering)
- ``aggregation.simplify_tolerance_km``: Geometry simplification tolerance

Resource Classes
----------------

Within each optimization region, agricultural land is heterogeneous—some areas have high yield potential, others low. To capture this heterogeneity without creating a separate decision variable for each gridcell, the model groups land into **resource classes** based on yield potential quantiles.

Concept
~~~~~~~

For example, with quantiles ``[0.25, 0.5, 0.75]``, each region has 4 resource classes:

- **Class 0**: Bottom 25% of yield potential (lowest quality land)
- **Class 1**: 25th–50th percentile
- **Class 2**: 50th–75th percentile
- **Class 3**: Top 25% of yield potential (highest quality land)

This stratification allows the model to:

- Preferentially allocate high-value crops to high-quality land
- Avoid optimistic bias from averaging yields across heterogeneous land
- Capture marginal land-use decisions at the extensive margin

Resource classes are computed by assigning a productivity score to every
gridcell, then binning those scores into unweighted quantiles within each
region. The default ``aggregation.resource_class_score:
"regional_crop_mix_actual_yield"`` normalizes each crop/water yield raster
by that crop/water combination's global harvested-area-weighted median
actual yield, then scores every gridcell by a weighted average of those
normalized yields using the region's current harvested crop mix as weights.
Missing crop yields in a gridcell are ignored rather than treated as zero,
and cells with no valid actual-yield score are left unclassified. The
final class boundaries remain ordinary within-region gridcell quantiles.
This mode requires ``validation.use_actual_yields: true``, which is the
default in ``default.yaml``; the workflow raises an error if the score
method is kept but ``use_actual_yields`` is overridden to ``false``.

Alternatively, ``aggregation.resource_class_score`` can be set to
``"max_yield"``, in which case the score is the maximum modelled crop yield
in the gridcell. This uses GAEZ potential-yield rasters in standard runs
and GAEZ actual-yield rasters when ``validation.use_actual_yields`` is
enabled.

Land Availability
-----------------

Land availability is constrained by **suitability** from GAEZ, which indicates what fraction of each gridcell is suitable for agriculture.

Suitability-Based Limits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GAEZ provides separate suitability rasters for rainfed and irrigated production. The aggregation process:

1. Load suitability fractions (0–1) for each crop and water supply
2. Multiply by cell area (hectares) to get suitable area
3. Aggregate by region, resource class, and water supply

The ``regional_limit`` parameter (e.g., 0.7) caps total usable land at a fraction of the suitable area, representing institutional, ecological, or social constraints on agricultural expansion.

Irrigated vs. Rainfed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model distinguishes between irrigated and rainfed production:

**Rainfed**
  - Uses rainfall for water supply
  - Available on suitable cropland not equipped for irrigation
  - Generally lower yields than irrigated

**Irrigated**
  - Requires irrigation infrastructure
  - Only available on land equipped for irrigation (from GAEZ dataset)
  - Higher yields but consumes blue water (see :doc:`crop_production` for water constraints)

For each region and resource class, the model maintains separate land variables for rainfed and irrigated production.

Current Grassland: Convertible vs Marginal
-------------------------------------------

The model splits current grassland into two explicit pools within each ``(region, resource_class)``:

- **Cropland-suitable current grassland**: Current grassland area that lies on land suitable for crop growth (GAEZ suitable)
- **Marginal current grassland**: Current grazing-only grassland that is not suitable for crop growth

Data sources and split:

- ``build_current_grassland_area`` provides total current grassland (physical area) from LUIcube grassland rasters, plus a per-aggregate mean grazing intensity used downstream for forage efficiency. See "Pasture supply vs LUC pasture fraction" below for why the area is physical rather than GI-weighted.
- ``build_grazing_only_land`` estimates the marginal (grazing-only) subset on the same physical basis.
- Cropland-suitable current grassland is computed as ``max(current_grassland - grazing_only, 0)``

.. figure:: https://github.com/Sustainable-Solutions-Lab/GLADE/releases/download/doc-figures/grazing_only_land_fraction.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Fraction of each gridcell and region classified as grassland

   Global grassland availability. Left panel: gridcell fraction that is grassland. Right panel: share of each region's land budget in the grassland pool.

Both current grassland pools flow to the **pasture pool** via ``existing_grassland_to_pasture`` links. Both can also be spared for carbon sequestration via ``spare_existing_grassland`` links.

Only the **cropland-suitable current grassland** pool is subtracted from the rainfed new-land expansion potential, preventing double-counting while preserving the distinct marginal grassland pool.

This separation ensures that:

- Ruminant feed has a realistic existing grassland supply without depleting cropland
- Every hectare is accounted for exactly once
- Sparing decisions reflect the actual opportunity cost of each land type

Pasture supply vs LUC pasture fraction
---------------------------------------

The feed side and the carbon side describe pasture from the same LUIcube
grassland layer but resolve sub-pixel overlap with forest and cropland
differently, because grazing and carbon ask different questions:

1. **LP pasture supply pool** (``build_current_grassland_area``,
   ``build_grazing_only_land``): the **full physical** grassland area
   from LUIcube, summed across every grassland pixel that overlaps each
   ``(region, resource_class)`` cell. Per-pixel grazing intensity (GI)
   is exported separately and applied at the *efficiency* step in
   ``build_model/grassland.py``: per-Mha forage output equals
   ``GI * yield``, so total feed capacity is
   ``sum(physical_area * GI * yield)``. Grazing that happens *between
   trees* (silvopasture) or on *crop stubble* is genuine forage and is
   counted here in full.

2. **LUC carbon partition** (``prepare_luc_inputs``,
   ``build_luc_carbon_coefficients``): each hectare is assigned to its
   **dominant cover**. Observed forest and cropland take their full
   area; pasture fills only the remaining *open* grazed land. The same
   between-the-trees / stubble grazing does *not* change the pixel's
   carbon stock -- the canopy and tilled soil still hold the carbon and
   de-stocking sequesters little extra -- so for carbon that hectare is
   forest or cropland, not pasture. Grazing intensity then enters the
   carbon coefficients as a per-hectare **depletion** factor (a lightly
   grazed open hectare carries near-natural AGB/SOC), and the
   spared-land regrowth credit is gated by reforestation potential
   rather than by grazing intensity.

On genuinely open grazed land (steppe, savanna) forest and cropland are
near zero, so the two definitions **coincide**: the carbon partition
treats grazed open land as pasture exactly as the feed side does. They
differ only where grass overlaps forest or cropland, and there the
difference is physical (the same hectare is grazed *and* forested/tilled)
rather than an accounting artifact. This keeps forest carbon fully
protected (no rangeland-vs-forest mis-assignment) while still treating
open grazing as pasture for both forage and carbon.

**If you change either definition** -- e.g. by GI-weighting the LP
pool, or by switching the LUC side to a different managed-fraction
proxy -- you must rerun the full calibration cascade
(``tools/calibrate``) and confirm the stability L1 cost stays in a
balanced regime. A previous attempt to align the two on the managed
fraction (commit ``4cada27``, reverted) caused the land L1 cost to
jump roughly an order of magnitude and forced an undesirable rescale
of the GSA L1 sensitivity bounds.

Land Use Change
---------------

When the model allocates more land to agriculture than the existing baseline, this represents **land use change** (LUC). The environmental impacts—primarily carbon emissions from clearing vegetation—are captured via efficiency coefficients on the conversion links.

See :doc:`environment` for details on how LUC emissions are calculated from above-ground biomass, soil organic carbon, and foregone regrowth potential.

Land Conversion Costs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Expanding agriculture onto new land incurs physical investment costs for clearing vegetation, stumping, grading, and initial soil preparation. These costs are applied as ``marginal_cost`` on ``land_conversion`` (cropland expansion) and ``new_to_pasture`` (pasture expansion) links, differentiated by cover type:

- **Forest → agriculture**: ``conversion_cost_forest_usd_per_ha`` (default: 8,000 USD/ha) — covers clearing dense vegetation, stumping, grading, and soil preparation.
- **Non-forest → agriculture**: ``conversion_cost_nonforest_usd_per_ha`` (default: 2,000 USD/ha) — lighter clearing of brush and grassland with soil preparation.

These values are in the model's currency base year (2024 USD).

Since these are one-time investment costs, they are annualized using a **capital recovery factor** (CRF):

.. math::

   \text{CRF} = \frac{r}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}

where *r* is the discount rate (``discount_rate``, default 0.05) and *n* is the investment horizon (``investment_horizon``, default 30 years, matching the LUC emissions horizon). The annualized cost is then converted to model units (bnUSD/Mha) and applied to the conversion links.

**Sources and rationale for default cost values.**
Direct estimates of the full private cost of converting land to crop-ready agriculture are sparse in the academic literature, which tends to focus on opportunity costs and returns from conversion rather than upfront clearing expenditure. The default values are chosen as middle-of-the-road estimates based on the following sources (original values inflation-adjusted to approximate 2024 USD where needed):

*Forest clearing:*

- The FAO Soils Bulletin 19 (FAO, 1979) reports that manual clearing of tropical high forest requires ~86 man-days/ha, while previously logged forest requires ~50 man-days/ha. At modern developing-country wages, this implies $430--1,300/ha for labor alone, before stumping, grading, and soil preparation.
- Margulis (2004), in World Bank Working Paper No. 22, reports ~$500/ha (~$830/ha in 2024 USD) for basic slash-and-burn clearing in the Brazilian Amazon — the cheapest method, representing a lower bound.
- An IUCN workshop on land clearing economics (IUCN, 2002) found that mechanized clearing of secondary forest in Indonesia costs $600--1,800/ha (~$1,050--3,150/ha in 2024 USD), while fire-based clearing costs $200--595/ha.
- Nhiuane et al. (2024), in *Trees, Forests and People*, report clearing costs of $302--508/ha for slash-and-burn and $1,662/ha for conventional logging-based clearing in Mozambique.
- Oil palm plantation development in Southeast Asia, which includes clearing, stumping, terracing, and establishment, costs $3,000--8,000/ha (Sumarga & Hein, 2014; industry reports).

The default of 8,000 USD/ha represents the full cost of bringing forested land to a crop-ready state at commercial scale, including clearing, stumping, root removal, grading, soil preparation, and basic access infrastructure. This is above the cost of tree-felling alone, but below the total cost of plantation establishment which includes planting and multi-year maintenance.

*Non-forest clearing:*

- The FAO Soils Bulletin 19 (FAO, 1979) notes that jungle clearing costs up to 120 times as much as light brush clearing.
- The IUCN (2002) workshop describes alang-alang grassland clearing costs as "substantially lower" than secondary forest, implying a ratio of roughly 3:1 for the same clearing method.
- Nhiuane et al. (2024) report $302--508/ha for slash-and-burn clearing of savanna woodland in Mozambique.

The default of 2,000 USD/ha covers mechanized clearing of brush and grassland plus soil preparation, consistent with a 4:1 forest-to-non-forest ratio that falls within the range supported by the FAO and IUCN data.

Land Slack
~~~~~~~~~~

Validation runs that pin observed harvested area may encounter land-class mismatches. To maintain feasibility without globally loosening land limits, each land bus can receive a ``land_slack`` generator:

- Controlled by ``validation.land_slack: true``
- Marginal cost set by ``validation.slack_marginal_cost`` (bn USD per Mha)
- The default 50 bn USD/Mha (50,000 USD/ha) ensures slack activates only as a
  last resort

Multi-Cropping Land Correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In many regions, the total harvested area (summed across all crops on a cropland bus) exceeds the physical cropland supply because multiple crops are grown on the same land per year (multi-cropping). Without correction, the model would need land slack or new land conversion to accommodate what is actually existing multi-cropped land.

The ``add_multi_cropping_land_correction`` function in ``land.py`` adds non-extendable generators directly on deficit **cropland buses** after crop production links are built:

1. Computes **harvested/physical area** per cropland bus by summing ``baseline_area_mha`` across both crop-production carriers (``crop_production`` and ``crop_production_multi``)
2. Computes **existing supply** per cropland bus from ``land_use`` link capacities
3. Adds generators sized to ``max(harvested − supply, 0)`` on each deficit bus

These generators:

- Use carrier ``multi_cropping_land_correction`` (unit: Mha)
- Are named ``supply:multi_cropping_correction:{region}_c{class}_{water}``
- Have the same marginal cost as existing land use (no penalty)
- Are non-extendable (the correction is sized exactly to the observed deficit)
- Do not connect to emission buses (no LUC emissions)
- Do not affect pasture pools (cropland buses only)

This correction runs unconditionally in all model configurations, after the
multi-cropping links are added and the single-crop baselines reconciled.

**Relationship to multi-cropping links.** The model also has explicit
multi-cropping *links* (see :doc:`crop_production`) that let the optimizer
allocate additional crop cycles on the same land within a single year. These
carry an observed MIRCA-OS baseline and are treated like single-crop production
in every anchoring context: the land deviation penalty, churn budgets, the
crop growth cap, and validation-mode pinning (``use_actual_production`` fixes
both carriers at their reconciled baselines). Because each ``n``-cycle multi link draws one
hectare of physical land while its harvested cycles are removed from the
single-crop baselines, the correction generators only absorb the *residual*
extra-cycle area that is not attributed to any modelled combination (for
example, rotations outside the curated catalog or crops GLADE does not model).
