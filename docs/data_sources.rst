5. Register for a Copernicus Climate Data Store account and configure your API key to enable automatic retrieval of land cover data (:ref:`copernicus-land-cover`).


.. _weight-bases:

Weight bases for animal products
--------------------------------

Animal-product mass appears in several different "weight bases" along
the supply chain. Mixing these silently is a common source of bugs, so
the project tracks them explicitly in column names and in loader/writer
docstrings. For animal foods specifically:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 18 60

   * - Basis
     - Notation
     - Definition
   * - Live weight
     - LW
     - The animal alive on the farm. Not used directly in the model.
   * - Carcass weight equivalent
     - CWE
     - The slaughtered carcass with bones, blood drained. FAOSTAT FBS
       reports meat in CWE; FAOSTAT QCL "Meat of … with the bone, fresh
       or chilled" is also CWE.
   * - Fresh retail
     - retail
     - Boneless, trimmed cuts as sold to the consumer; equals
       ``CWE × carcass_to_retail`` (OECD-FAO 2023 Box 6.1: 67 % cattle,
       73 % pig, 60 % chicken, 66 % sheep). Dairy and eggs use
       ``carcass_to_retail = 1`` (no conversion).
   * - Intake
     - intake
     - What people actually consume; equals
       ``retail × (1 − loss_fraction) × (1 − waste_fraction)``. This is
       what dietary intake surveys measure (GDD, GBD, NHANES) and the
       basis the model's food bus delivers after the ``animal_production``
       link applies its FLW multiplier.

CSV columns and config keys carry an explicit suffix where the basis
matters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 45 25 30

   * - Column / file
     - Basis
     - Source
   * - ``faostat_animal_production.csv:production_mt_fresh_retail``
     - retail
     - QCL element 5510 × ``carcass_to_retail_meat`` (raw fresh weight
       for milk and eggs).
   * - ``baseline_diet.csv:consumption_g_per_day_intake``
     - intake
     - GDD/GBD/FAOSTAT/NHANES intake surveys, or for FBS-overridden
       foods, ``FBS_supply × within_FBS_share × carcass_to_retail
       × (1 − loss) × (1 − waste)``.
   * - ``faostat_fbs_items.csv:supply_kg_per_capita_year``
     - CWE for meat;
       fresh for milk/eggs/crops
     - FAOSTAT FBS element 645 (`Food supply quantity, kg/capita/yr`).
       Mixed-unit file: meat items are CWE per FAOSTAT convention;
       crops are fresh weight. Convert to retail by multiplying with
       ``carcass_to_retail_meat`` for meat items.
   * - ``feed_baseline.csv:feed_use_mt_dm``
     - dry matter
     - GLEAM 3.0 (already explicit).

Source selection for animal products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For animal products the project uses **FAOSTAT throughout** — both
production (QCL) and per-country food supply (FBS) — because:

* QCL slaughter-volume data is more reliable than self-reported intake
  for socially significant foods like red meat, and FBS aggregates the
  same QCL primary commodities into a closed
  ``production + trade − non-food − loss`` balance per country.
* Anchoring the consumption side to FBS supply with the same FLW
  factors used on the production side keeps diet and supply on the same
  intake basis at baseline, so the food-balance constraint closes
  without artificial slack.
* Trade falls out for free: FBS supply per country already nets in
  imports and exports, so per-country diet matches what FAOSTAT reports
  each country actually consumed. The model's trade hubs reproduce the
  observed flows at solve time.

The exception is **dairy**, which uses GDD-disaggregated values rather
than an FBS override. Dairy's ``food_loss_waste`` convention lumps
non-food uses of raw milk (calf feed, processing, industrial) into a
single 30 % factor, because the model has no separate non-food milk
outlet. Under that convention the GDD-based dairy total happens to
mass-balance against the production-side ``QCL × 0.7`` delivered to the
food bus; switching to FBS would break that balance. See
:ref:`Why animal products use FBS, not GDD <animal-source-selection>`
for the full rationale.

FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheets (FBS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: FAO Statistics Division

**Description**: Per-capita food supply quantities (kg/capita/year) by country, item, and year from FAO's global statistical database covering 245+ countries from 1961 onward. We use the Grand Total item to benchmark available food supply when scaling food waste fractions, and per-commodity supply data to supplement baseline dietary intake estimates.

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: 245+ countries and territories
  * Temporal: 1961 onward

**Access**: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/ (Food Balance Sheets domain)

**License**: CC BY 4.0 + FAO database terms (`Terms of Use <https://www.fao.org/contact-us/terms/db-terms-of-use/en/>`_)

**Citation**: FAO. FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheets. https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/

UNSD SDG Indicator 12.3.1 (Food Loss & Waste)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD)

**Description**: SDG indicator database series ``AG_FLS_PCT`` (Food loss percentage) and ``AG_FOOD_WST_PC`` (Food waste per capita) covering SDG 12.3.1a/b.

**Version**: 2025 Q4.1 release; bulk CSV (~56 MB zip, ~1.7 GB uncompressed), filtered during extraction to the two relevant series (~500 KB)

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: Global
  * Temporal: Varies by country

**Access**: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal; bulk archive at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/archive

**License**: UNdata terms -- data may be copied and redistributed free of charge provided UNdata/UNSD is cited.

**Citation**: United Nations Statistics Division. SDG Indicator Database, Goal 12.3.1a/b (Food Loss and Waste). https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal

**Retrieval**: Retrieved via the ``download_unsd_sdg`` rule (bulk zip download) and ``extract_unsd_sdg`` rule (filter to AG_FLS_PCT and AG_FOOD_WST_PC series). Output: ``data/downloads/unsd/SDG_12_3_1.csv``. Processed by ``prepare_food_loss_waste.py``.

**Usage**: Supplies per-country loss and waste fractions for food groups, injected into the crop-to-food conversion efficiencies during ``build_model``.

**Curated overrides**: Where the SDG/FBS-derived defaults are known to under-
or over-correct against survey-based intake data, ``prepare_food_loss_waste.py``
applies values from ``data/curated/food_loss_waste_overrides.csv``. Each
override row carries a ``source`` field that must cite a published estimate.
Country-specific rows take precedence over global rows
(``country == "*"``). Currently in use:

* **dairy** (global, ``waste_fraction = 0.30``): the SDG country-level waste
  fraction is a single all-foods average that systematically under-corrects
  dairy. USDA ERS Loss-Adjusted Food Availability puts combined retail and
  consumer loss at ~32% for fluid milk and dairy products in the United
  States, and FAO Save Food (Gustavsson et al. 2011) reports comparable
  industrialised-region losses with 14–19% post-harvest loss in low-income
  regions. The override brings modelled dairy intake into line with intake
  surveys (e.g. NHANES What We Eat in America), where the unmodified
  pipeline over-estimated US dairy by roughly a factor of two.

FADN Livestock Costs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The FADN dataset provides livestock production cost data for animal products:

**Coverage**: 4 livestock categories (dairy cattle, beef cattle, pigs, poultry)

**Cost variables**: Same farm overhead costs as crops (SE340-SE380), plus livestock-specific costs (SE320 - veterinary, breeding, etc.)

**Explicitly EXCLUDED**: Purchased feed costs (SE310 - modeled endogenously), rent paid (SE375)

**Methodology**: A yield-based "bottom-up" approach is used to calculate costs per tonne:

1.  **Allocation**: Farm costs are allocated to livestock categories proportionally by output value, normalized by Total Farm Output (SE131) to properly account for mixed farming systems.
2.  **Unit Cost**: Costs are normalized to **Cost per Head** using Eurostat livestock unit (LU) coefficients (e.g., 1 Dairy Cow = 1 LU, 1 Pig = 0.3 LU).
3.  **Yield Conversion**: Cost per Head is converted to **Cost per Tonne** using country-specific physical yields derived from FAOSTAT (Production / Stocks). This ensures consistent physical metrics across all products and countries, correcting for internal data gaps in FADN reporting.

**Currency adjustment**: Same as crops (EUR -> USD using PPP, inflation-adjusted to base year)

**Usage**: Provides EU livestock production cost estimates, complementing USDA data. Costs are merged with USDA animal cost data via ``merge_animal_costs`` rule; when both sources have data for a product, values are averaged. Workflow: ``retrieve_fadn_animal_costs`` script -> ``processing/{name}/fadn_animal_costs.csv`` -> merged with USDA animal costs -> ``processing/{name}/animal_costs.csv``.

NHANES / FPED -- What We Eat in America
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: USDA Agricultural Research Service, Food Surveys Research Group (in partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services / CDC NHANES)

**Description**: "What We Eat in America" is the dietary intake interview component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) translates each reported food into USDA Food Pattern equivalents (cup-eq, ounce-eq, teaspoon-eq, or grams) for 37 food-pattern components. We consume the released demographic-table summary (mean amounts of equivalents consumed per individual, by male/female and age) for the most recent prepandemic NHANES cycle and use it as an intake-based override for the United States.

**Version**: FPED 1720 -- "for use with WWEIA, NHANES 2017-March 2020 Prepandemic". Single-PDF demographic table (~160 KB), USDA ARS / FSRG, 2023 release.

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: United States only.
  * Content: Mean daily intake of fruit, vegetables, grains (whole and refined), dairy, meat / poultry / seafood / eggs / nuts and seeds, legumes, oils, solid fats, added sugars, and alcoholic drinks for the population aged 2+ (and finer male/female × age strata which we do not currently consume).

**Retrieval**: Automatic via the ``download_nhanes_fped`` rule (URL templated by FPED cycle, default ``1720``). The PDF is parsed with ``pdftotext`` (poppler) by ``prepare_nhanes_dietary_intake.py``; the column-to-food-group mapping and unit conversions live in the curated CSV ``data/curated/nhanes_fped_mapping.csv``, with conversion factors sourced from USDA MyPlate cup/ounce-equivalent definitions and the FPED Methodology and User Guide.

**Usage**: For the United States, NHANES values take precedence over both GDD intake estimates and FAOSTAT food-supply estimates in ``merge_dietary_sources.py`` for every food group it covers (fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, refined and whole grains, dairy, eggs, oils, red meat, poultry, nuts and seeds, legumes, sugar). Coverage of other intake-survey-based national datasets (e.g. CCHS for Canada, ENSANUT for Mexico) can be added in the same precedence layer.

The FPED columns are *fat-stripped decompositions* rather than food masses:
FPED Total Dairy is the low-fat / skim-equivalent fraction (butterfat is
extracted into a separate Solid Fats axis), and Meat / Poultry are reported
as lean fractions. Three projection adjustments are therefore applied to
arrive at modelled-food masses:

* **Butter top-up**: ``prepare_nhanes_dietary_intake.py`` reads FAOSTAT FBS
  Butter and Ghee (item 2740) for the configured country, applies the FAO
  dairy-commodity-tree milk-equivalent factor (21.3) and the country-level
  dairy waste fraction, and adds the result to the FPED Total Dairy value.
* **Cured meat fold**: FPED Cured Meat is added into ``red_meat`` to match
  the GDD v09 fold and keep consumption consistent with FAOSTAT
  slaughter-volume production accounting.
* **Fruit juice projection**: FPED Fruit Juice cup-equivalents are
  projected onto fresh-fruit-equivalent grams under ``fruits`` (USDA
  MyPlate counts 1 cup juice as 1 cup fruit).

All cup-, oz-, and tsp-equivalent conversion factors used in
``data/curated/nhanes_fped_mapping.csv`` are sourced row-by-row from
the FPED Methodology and User Guide
(`Bowman et al. 2020 <https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/fped/FPED_1718.pdf>`_)
Tables 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13. One factor -- the grams-per-oz-equivalent
for grains -- is an explicit modelling **assumption** rather than a
published value. FPED MUG Table 10 gives two rules: 16 g flour per
ounce-equivalent for flour-based products (bread, biscuits, pancakes,
crackers, baked goods) and 28.35 g grain per ounce-equivalent for
intact grains (rice, pasta, oats, RTE cereals). The FPED demographic
table aggregates the two product types into a single oz-eq column per
grain group without an external mix breakdown, so we apply the
unweighted midpoint (~22 g/oz-eq) as a deliberate compromise. The
trade-off is documented in the per-row note in the mapping CSV; if a
better-sourced US-mix breakdown becomes available, the factor should
be updated accordingly.

**API Key**: The repository includes a shared API key for convenience. Users can optionally obtain their own API key (free, instant signup) at https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup and update the ``data.usda.api_key`` value in the config.

**Usage**: Nutritional composition of model foods (protein, carbohydrates, fat, energy). The mapping from model foods to USDA FoodData Central IDs is maintained in ``data/curated/usda_food_mapping.csv``.

FAO Nutrient Conversion Table for SUA (2024)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)

**Description**: Official nutrient conversion factors that align FAO Supply Utilization Account (SUA) quantities with macro- and micronutrient totals for hundreds of food items.

**Version**: 2024 Excel workbook

**Access**: https://www.fao.org/3/CC9678EN/Nutrient_conversion_table_for_SUA_2024.xlsx

**License**: (C) FAO 2024. Reuse for private study, research, teaching, or other non-commercial purposes is allowed with acknowledgement of FAO; translation, adaptation, resale, and commercial uses require prior permission via copyright@fao.org.

**Retrieval**: Automatically downloaded to ``data/downloads/fao_nutrient_conversion_table_for_sua_2024.xlsx`` by the ``download_fao_nutrient_conversion_table`` rule.

**Usage**: Contains data on edible portion of foods. ``workflow/scripts/prepare_fao_edible_portion.py`` reads sheet ``03`` to export edible portion coefficients for configured crops into ``processing/{name}/fao_edible_portion.csv``. Moisture fractions required for fresh-mass scaling live in ``data/curated/crop_moisture_content.csv`` (derived primarily from the GAEZ v5 Module VII documentation with a few documented assumptions) and are joined inside ``workflow/scripts/build_model.py``. Note that for certain crops (grains: rice, barley, oat, buckwheat; sugar crops: sugarcane, sugarbeet; oil crops: oil-palm, rapeseed), the script overrides FAO's coefficients to 1.0 so that downstream processing pathways manage the losses explicitly.
