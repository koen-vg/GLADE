Data Sources
============

Overview
--------

The model integrates multiple global datasets covering agricultural production, climate, population, health, and water resources. This page documents all external datasets used by the project, their licenses, and how to obtain them.

.. _manual-download-checklist:

Manual Download Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several licensed datasets cannot be fetched automatically. While their use is free for non-commercial research purposes, these have to be downloaded manually or require API key registration.

**Required only for the health module / GBD diet anchoring:**

The following IHME GBD datasets are needed **only** when the health
module is enabled (``health.enabled: true``) or when the baseline diet
anchors to GBD (``diet.anchor_groups_to_gbd``; see
:ref:`current-diets-gbd-anchoring`). With both off -- the default -- they
are not required and the workflow runs without them. If they are missing
while needed, the workflow stops at startup with an explicit message.

1. Create an account with IHME and download GBD death rates as described in :ref:`ihme-gbd-mortality`.
2. Download the IHME 2023 dietary risk exposure estimates (two archives, ``IHME_GBD_2023_RISK_EXPOSURE_DIET_1`` and ``_2``) (:ref:`ihme-diet-risk-exposure`).

**Optional (only to regenerate curated health inputs):**

3. The IHME 2019 relative risk workbook ``IHME_GBD_2019_RELATIVE_RISKS_Y2020M10D15.XLSX`` (:ref:`ihme-relative-risks`) is only used by a standalone curation script to regenerate the git-tracked RR age-attenuation table; it is not consumed by the normal workflow.

The baseline diet needs no manual downloads: the default GDD-IA source
(:ref:`gdd-ia-dietary-intake`) is fetched automatically from Zenodo.

The one build-time credential is a free USDA FoodData Central key, used only to refresh the nutritional data (see :doc:`introduction`). Everything else is fetched from public downloads, Zenodo (the GDD-IA dataset, :ref:`gdd-ia-dietary-intake`, and our land-cover mirror, :ref:`copernicus-land-cover`), or bundled data.


.. _weight-bases:

Weight bases for animal products
--------------------------------

Animal-product mass appears in several different "weight bases" along
the supply chain. Mixing these silently is a common source of bugs, so
the project tracks them explicitly in column names and in loader/writer
docstrings. For animal foods specifically:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 22 18 60

   * - Basis
     - Notation
     - Definition
   * - Live weight
     - LW
     - The animal alive on the farm. Not used directly in the model.
   * - Carcass weight equivalent
     - CWE
     - The slaughtered carcass with bones, blood drained. FAOSTAT FBS
       reports meat in CWE; FAOSTAT QCL "Meat of … with the bone, fresh
       or chilled" is also CWE.
   * - Fresh retail
     - retail
     - Boneless, trimmed cuts as sold to the consumer; equals
       ``CWE × carcass_to_retail`` (OECD-FAO 2023 Box 6.1: 67 % cattle,
       73 % pig, 60 % chicken, 66 % sheep). Dairy and eggs use
       ``carcass_to_retail = 1`` (no conversion).
   * - Intake
     - intake
     - What people actually consume; equals
       ``retail × (1 − loss_fraction) × (1 − waste_fraction)``. This is
       what dietary intake surveys measure (GDD, GBD, NHANES) and the
       basis the model's food bus delivers after the ``animal_production``
       link applies its FLW multiplier.

CSV columns and config keys carry an explicit suffix where the basis
matters:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 45 25 30

   * - Column / file
     - Basis
     - Source
   * - ``faostat_animal_production.csv:production_mt_fresh_retail``
     - retail
     - QCL element 5510 × ``weight_conversion.carcass_to_fresh`` (raw
       fresh weight for milk and eggs).
   * - ``baseline_diet.csv:consumption_g_per_day_intake``
     - intake
     - GDD/GBD/FAOSTAT/NHANES intake surveys, or for FBS-overridden
       foods, ``FBS_supply × within_FBS_share × basis_factor
       × (1 − loss) × (1 − waste)``, where ``basis_factor`` resolves
       to ``weight_conversion.carcass_to_fresh`` for meats and
       ``weight_conversion.fresh_to_dry`` for tea-dried.
   * - ``faostat_fbs_items.csv:supply_kg_per_capita_year``
     - CWE for meat;
       fresh for milk/eggs/crops
     - FAOSTAT FBS element 645 (`Food supply quantity, kg/capita/yr`).
       Mixed-unit file: meat items are CWE per FAOSTAT convention;
       crops are fresh weight. Convert to retail via the shared
       ``weight_conversion.carcass_to_fresh`` table for meat items.
   * - ``feed_baseline.csv:feed_use_mt_dm``
     - dry matter
     - GLEAM 3.0 (already explicit).

Source selection for animal products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For animal products the project uses **FAOSTAT throughout** — both
production (QCL) and per-country food supply (FBS) — because:

* QCL slaughter-volume data is more reliable than self-reported intake
  for socially significant foods like red meat, and FBS aggregates the
  same QCL primary commodities into a closed
  ``production + trade − non-food − loss`` balance per country.
* Anchoring the consumption side to FBS supply with the same FLW
  factors used on the production side keeps diet and supply on the same
  intake basis at baseline, so the food-balance constraint closes
  without artificial slack.
* Trade falls out for free: FBS supply per country already nets in
  imports and exports, so per-country diet matches what FAOSTAT reports
  each country actually consumed. The model's trade hubs reproduce the
  observed flows at solve time.

The exception is **dairy**, which uses GDD-disaggregated values rather
than an FBS override. Dairy's ``food_loss_waste`` convention lumps
non-food uses of raw milk (calf feed, processing, industrial) into a
single 30 % factor, because the model has no separate non-food milk
outlet. Under that convention the GDD-based dairy total happens to
mass-balance against the production-side ``QCL × 0.7`` delivered to the
food bus; switching to FBS would break that balance. See
:ref:`Why animal products use FBS, not GDD <animal-source-selection>`
for the full rationale.


Agricultural Production Data
-----------------------------

GAEZ (Global Agro-Ecological Zones) v5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: FAO/IIASA

**Description**: Global crop suitability and attainable yield estimates under various climate and management scenarios.

**Version**: GAEZ v5; raster datasets (variables ``yc``, ``sx1``) under selected climate and management scenarios

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: Global, 0.083333° x 0.083333° (~5 arc-minute grid, ~9 km at the equator)
  * Temporal: Multiple climate scenarios

**Access**: https://data.apps.fao.org/gaez/ -- bulk downloads through a Google Cloud Storage interface

**License**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) + FAO database terms (`Terms of Use <https://www.fao.org/contact-us/terms/db-terms-of-use/en/>`_)

**Citation**: FAO/IIASA (2025). Global Agro-Ecological Zones v5 (GAEZ v5).

**Retrieval**: Automatic via Snakemake rules in ``workflow/rules/retrieve.smk``

**Usage**: Crop yield and suitability rasters feeding into production potential calculations. Crops listed in ``config["cropgrids_crops"]`` bypass GAEZ entirely and are sourced from CROPGRIDS + FAOSTAT instead (see next section).

CROPGRIDS v1.08
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: Tang, Nguyen, Conchedda, Casse, Tubiello & Maggi (2024)

**Description**: Global geo-referenced harvested and physical crop area maps for 173 crops around 2020 at 0.05° (~5.6 km) resolution; compiled from Monfreda et al. (2008) and 28 newer gridded sources, aligned to FAOSTAT statistics.

**Version**: v1.08 (Figshare release v9). The model uses only the per-crop NetCDF ``harvarea`` band.

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: Global, 0.05° × 0.05°
  * Temporal: Reference around 2020

**Access**: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/CROPGRIDS/22491997 (full dataset; DOI https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22491997)

**License**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)

**Citation**: Tang, F. H. M., Nguyen, T. H., Conchedda, G., Casse, L., Tubiello, F. N., & Maggi, F. (2024). *CROPGRIDS: a global geo-referenced dataset of 173 crops*. Scientific Data 11, 413. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03247-7

**Retrieval**: Bulk zip download via ``download_cropgrids_nc_maps`` (uses ``download_figshare_file.py``); per-crop NetCDFs extracted on demand by ``extract_cropgrids_nc``.

**Usage**: Fallback source of harvested area and current cropland footprint for crops listed in ``config["cropgrids_crops"]`` (e.g. ``apple``), which are not covered by GAEZ. The CROPGRIDS ``harvarea`` raster drives both ``baseline_area_mha`` and ``suitable_area`` for these crops (see ``build_crop_yields_cropgrids.py``); per-country FAOSTAT QCL yields (item 515 for apple, element 5419 hg/ha) supply the dry-matter yield, broadcast uniformly to every (region, resource_class) cell within each country.

AWARE2.0
~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: Seitfudem, Berger, Mueller Schmied & Boulay (2025)

**Description**: The updated water-scarcity characterisation method for life-cycle assessment, built on WaterGAP 2.2e. The model uses the native-basin geopackage: hydrological basin polygons carrying annual and monthly characterisation factors. The annual agricultural CF is the basin scarcity signal used to split provinces along basin boundaries when building model regions (see :doc:`land_use`).

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: Global, 11661 native hydrological basins

**Access**: Zenodo record 15133241 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15133241), file ``AWARE20_Native_CFs_geospatial.gpkg`` (5.3 MB).

**License**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)

**Citation**: Seitfudem, G., Berger, M., Mueller Schmied, H., & Boulay, A.-M. (2025). *The updated and improved method for water scarcity impact assessment in LCA, AWARE2.0*. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15133241

**Retrieval**: ``download_aware2`` fetches the geopackage plus two workbooks (intermediate hydrological variables and native characterisation factors with sectoral demand) from Zenodo. Basins whose annual agricultural CF is missing (about a fifth of polygons, mostly ice, desert and small islands) are filled with the global median.

**Usage**: the basin geometries drive basin-aware region clustering (see :doc:`land_use`); the characterisation factors and hydrological variables build the regional water-scarcity supply curve (see :doc:`water`).

WaterGAP 2.2e
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: Mueller Schmied et al. (2024), via ISIMIP3a

**Description**: Global hydrological and water-use model output. The model uses the groundwater storage compartment (``groundwstor``; its long-term decline is groundwater depletion), potential irrigation water consumption in total (``pirruse``) and from groundwater (``pirrusegw``), and all-sector potential groundwater consumption (``ptotusegw``, the denominator of irrigation's share of the depletion trend). The surface part (``pirruse - pirrusegw``) is the irrigation surface availability that scales the AWARE scarcity curve; ``pirrusegw`` (net of irrigation-attributed mining) gives the renewable groundwater bands; ``pirruse`` anchors the consumptive-efficiency calibration and the mining ceiling.

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: Global, 0.5 degree
  * Temporal: Monthly, 1901-2019 (obsclim / histsoc, gswp3-w5e5 forcing)

**Access**: https://files.isimip.org (ISIMIP3a water_global / WaterGAP2-2e); the static continental-area grid via https://doi.org/10.25716/GUDE.0TNY-KJPG.

**License**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)

**Retrieval**: ``download_watergap_isimip`` and ``download_watergap_continental_area``.

**Usage**: The volume basis for the whole water system -- supply envelope, groundwater bands, demand timing and the ``eta_c`` anchor. See :doc:`water`.

MIRCA-OS v2
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: Kebede, Oluoch, Siebert & others (2025)

**Description**: Global gridded monthly irrigated and rainfed cropped-area dataset (an open-source update of MIRCA2000), 5-arcmin, for 23 crop classes and the years 2000-2020. The model selects the release nearest ``baseline_year`` from 2010, 2015, and 2020 (ties select the earlier year). Its annual harvested-area grids count every harvested cycle, while the maximum-monthly-cropped-area grids provide the AEI-capped physical field footprint. The ``Rice1/2/3`` subcrop grids identify repeated same-crop cycles.

**Version**: v2 (adds 2020 relative to the v0.1 preprint release).

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: Global, 5-arcmin (~10 km)
  * Temporal: 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020 (the workflow currently retrieves 2010, 2015, and 2020)

**Access**: HydroShare resource ``e4582ca0042148338bb5e0148b749ed6`` (https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/e4582ca0042148338bb5e0148b749ed6/).

**License**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)

**Citation**: Kebede, E. A., et al. (2025). *A global open-source dataset of monthly irrigated and rainfed cropped areas (MIRCA-OS) for the 21st century*. Scientific Data 12, 208. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-04313-w

**Retrieval**: The per-file HydroShare endpoint 500s for this resource, so the grid archives are fetched as members of the whole-resource BagIt zip via partial HTTP-range extraction (``download_mirca_os_bag_member.py``); the nested RAR5 archives are unpacked in one batch per product and year with ``bsdtar`` (``extract_mirca_os_*`` rules). The v2 archive ships only ``ir`` and ``rf`` footprint layers despite its README mentioning a ``tot`` layer. The derivation uses each layer with the matching water supply.

**Usage**: Source of the observed multiple-cropping baseline (see
:doc:`crop_production`) and observed irrigated demand calendar (see
:doc:`water`). The monthly calendar grids are converted to an untracked shared
sparse artefact under ``processing/shared/mirca_os/``; the original downloaded
files remain unchanged. The MIRCA-OS-to-GLADE crop concordance is in
``data/curated/mirca_os_crop_mapping.csv``; the fixed candidate sequence catalog
is in ``data/curated/mirca_os_multicropping_combinations.yaml``.

FAOSTAT Prices (PP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: FAO Statistics Division

**Description**: Producer prices in USD per tonne for agricultural commodities, used together with FAOSTAT Production (QCL) yields to derive per-(crop, country) production cost estimates.

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: 245+ countries and territories
  * Temporal: 1991 onward
  * Element 5532: Producer Price (USD/tonne)

**Access**: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/PP (bulk download)

**License**: CC BY 4.0 + FAO database terms (`Terms of Use <https://www.fao.org/contact-us/terms/db-terms-of-use/en/>`_)

**Citation**: FAO. FAOSTAT Producer Prices. https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/

**Retrieval**: Bulk zip download via ``download_faostat_pp`` rule, converted to Parquet by ``extract_faostat_pp``. Output: ``data/downloads/faostat/PP.parquet``.

**Usage**: Combined with QCL yields and a configurable ``non_endogenous_cost_share`` to produce per-(crop, country) crop production costs in ``prepare_faostat_crop_costs``. Prices are CPI-deflated to the configured base year before averaging. Crops without FAOSTAT price data use proxy mappings from ``data/curated/faostat_cost_proxies.yaml``. See :doc:`costs` for full methodology. The same domain also supplies producer prices for crops and animal products (mapped via ``data/curated/faostat_animal_price_item_map.csv``) in ``prepare_producer_prices``, used for the per-country production value accounting; see :doc:`production_value`.

USDA Livestock Cost Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA ERS)

**Description**: Production cost estimates for major livestock products in the United States, including operating costs and allocated overhead.

**Version**: Excel files; temporal coverage varies by product

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: U.S. total (national averages)
  * Temporal: Milk 2005-present, cow-calf 2008-present, hogs 2010-present
  * Products: 3 major animal products (dairy/milk, beef cattle via cow-calf, pork via hogs)

**Access**:
  * Milk: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/milk-cost-of-production-estimates/
  * Commodity Costs and Returns (includes cow-calf, hogs): https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commodity-costs-and-returns/

**License**: Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)

**Citation**: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service. Milk Cost of Production Estimates / Commodity Costs and Returns (Livestock).

**Retrieval**: Excel download and processing via ``workflow/scripts/retrieve_usda_animal_costs.py``. The script implements robust retries (5 attempts with backoff) to handle intermittent server timeouts. URLs are listed in ``data/curated/usda_animal_cost_sources.csv``.
  * **Manual Fallback**: If automated retrieval fails, users can manually download the CSVs from the URLs listed in ``data/curated/usda_animal_cost_sources.csv`` and place them in the processing directory, or simply re-run the workflow as the server often recovers.

**Usage**: Production cost estimates per unit of output. Costs are converted from per-head-per-year or per-cwt to per-tonne-product for model integration.

Costs explicitly **excluded** (modeled endogenously):

* Feed costs (crops and grassland modeled separately)
* Land costs and grazing rent (land allocation is optimized)

**Included costs**: Labor, veterinary services, energy, housing, equipment depreciation, interest on operating capital

**Inflation adjustment**: Costs are inflation-adjusted to the configurable base year (default: 2024) using US CPI-U data from BLS.

**Note**: USDA animal cost data is merged with EU FADN livestock data via the ``merge_animal_costs`` rule. Products without direct source data (currently ``meat-chicken``, ``meat-sheep``, ``dairy-buffalo``) are resolved through an alias-then-literature fallback chain configured under ``animal_costs`` in ``config/default.yaml``; see :ref:`animal_cost_fallbacks` for the values and references. When data is available from multiple sources, costs are averaged.

.. _bls-cpi-data:

BLS Consumer Price Index (CPI-U)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) |
**Access**: https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/ |
**License**: Public domain

Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), U.S. city average, all items (series CUUR0000SA0). Used for inflation adjustment of cost data throughout the workflow. Annual CPI averages are computed from monthly values and stored in ``processing/shared/cpi_annual.csv`` for reuse across the workflow. Retrieved automatically via BLS Public Data API (``workflow/scripts/retrieve_cpi_data.py``). Base year is configured via ``currency_base_year`` in ``config/default.yaml`` (default: 2024).

FAOSTAT Land Use (RL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: FAO Statistics Division

**Description**: Country-level land use statistics, including permanent meadows and pastures area. Used to cap satellite-derived grassland area to match FAOSTAT ground-truth pasture extent.

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: 245+ countries and territories
  * Temporal: 1961 onward

**Key variables**:
  * Item Code 6655: "Land under permanent meadows and pastures"
  * Element Code 5110: "Area" (in 1000 ha)

**Access**: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/ (Land Use domain)

**License**: CC BY 4.0 + FAO database terms

**Retrieval**: Downloaded as bulk CSV (``Inputs_LandUse_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip``), converted to Parquet, and processed by ``workflow/scripts/prepare_faostat_pasture_area.py``.

**Usage**: Provides per-country permanent pasture area used to scale down satellite grassland area in ``build_model.py``.

FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheets (FBS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: FAO Statistics Division

**Description**: Per-capita food supply quantities (kg/capita/year) by country, item, and year from FAO's global statistical database covering 245+ countries from 1961 onward. The model uses FBS item-level supply to disaggregate food-group totals into per-food consumption shares, to anchor the FBS-override foods in the baseline diet (meats, eggs, yam, coffee, cocoa), and to feed the food-loss-waste accounting.

**Version**: Retrieved via the FAOSTAT API using the ``faostat`` Python client (JSON -> Pandas DataFrame)

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: 245+ countries and territories
  * Temporal: 1961 onward

**Access**: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/ (Food Balance Sheets domain)

**License**: CC BY 4.0 + FAO database terms (`Terms of Use <https://www.fao.org/contact-us/terms/db-terms-of-use/en/>`_)

**Citation**: FAO. FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheets. https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/

**Retrieval**: Downloaded as a bulk CSV from FAOSTAT (converted to Parquet) and processed by scripts in ``workflow/scripts/`` (e.g., ``prepare_faostat_fbs_items.py``, ``prepare_food_loss_waste.py``, ``prepare_faostat_food_group_supply.py``).

**Usage**:
  * **Within-group disaggregation**: FBS item-level supply is the basis for per-food shares within each food group in ``estimate_baseline_diet.py``.
  * **FBS-anchored intake**: For the foods in ``diet.fbs_override_foods`` (meats, eggs, yam, coffee, cocoa), per-country intake is computed directly from FBS supply, the within-FBS-item share, the carcass-to-retail factor for meat, and the country/group consumer-waste fraction.
  * **Food loss and waste**: FBS Grand Total and per-item supply benchmark per-capita waste data when computing country- and group-level loss/waste fractions in ``prepare_food_loss_waste.py``.

UNSD SDG Indicator 12.3.1 (Food Loss & Waste)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD)

**Description**: SDG indicator database series ``AG_FLS_PCT`` (Food loss percentage) and ``AG_FOOD_WST_PC`` (Food waste per capita) covering SDG 12.3.1a/b.

**Version**: 2025 Q4.1 release; bulk CSV (~56 MB zip, ~1.7 GB uncompressed), filtered during extraction to the two relevant series (~500 KB)

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: Global
  * Temporal: Varies by country

**Access**: https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal; bulk archive at https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/archive

**License**: UNdata terms -- data may be copied and redistributed free of charge provided UNdata/UNSD is cited.

**Citation**: United Nations Statistics Division. SDG Indicator Database, Goal 12.3.1a/b (Food Loss and Waste). https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal

**Retrieval**: Retrieved via the ``download_unsd_sdg`` rule (bulk zip download) and ``extract_unsd_sdg`` rule (filter to AG_FLS_PCT and AG_FOOD_WST_PC series). Output: ``data/downloads/unsd/SDG_12_3_1.csv``. Processed by ``prepare_food_loss_waste.py``.

**Usage**: Supplies per-country loss and waste fractions for food groups, injected into the crop-to-food conversion efficiencies during ``build_model``.

**Curated overrides**: Where the SDG/FBS-derived defaults are known to under-
or over-correct against survey-based intake data, ``prepare_food_loss_waste.py``
applies values from ``data/curated/food_loss_waste_overrides.csv``. Each
override row carries a ``source`` field that must cite a published estimate.
Country-specific rows take precedence over global rows
(``country == "*"``). Currently in use:

* **dairy** (global, ``waste_fraction = 0.30``): the SDG country-level waste
  fraction is a single all-foods average that systematically under-corrects
  dairy. USDA ERS Loss-Adjusted Food Availability puts combined retail and
  consumer loss at ~32% for fluid milk and dairy products in the United
  States, and FAO Save Food (Gustavsson et al. 2011) reports comparable
  industrialised-region losses with 14–19% post-harvest loss in low-income
  regions. The override brings modelled dairy intake into line with intake
  surveys (e.g. NHANES What We Eat in America), where the unmodified
  pipeline over-estimated US dairy by roughly a factor of two.

IFA FUBC -- Global Fertilizer Use by Crop and Country
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: International Fertilizer Association (IFA) / Dryad

**Description**: Global dataset on inorganic fertilizer application rates (N, P2O5, K2O) by crop and country based on expert surveys.

FADN Livestock Costs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The FADN dataset provides livestock production cost data for animal products:

**Coverage**: 4 livestock categories (dairy cattle, beef cattle, pigs, poultry)

**Cost variables**: Same farm overhead costs as crops (SE340-SE380), plus livestock-specific costs (SE320 - veterinary, breeding, etc.)

**Explicitly EXCLUDED**: Purchased feed costs (SE310 - modeled endogenously), rent paid (SE375)

**Methodology**: A yield-based "bottom-up" approach is used to calculate costs per tonne:

1.  **Allocation**: Farm costs are allocated to livestock categories proportionally by output value, normalized by Total Farm Output (SE131) to properly account for mixed farming systems.
2.  **Unit Cost**: Costs are normalized to **Cost per Head** using Eurostat livestock unit (LU) coefficients (e.g., 1 Dairy Cow = 1 LU, 1 Pig = 0.3 LU).
3.  **Yield Conversion**: Cost per Head is converted to **Cost per Tonne** using country-specific physical yields derived from FAOSTAT (Production / Stocks). This ensures consistent physical metrics across all products and countries, correcting for internal data gaps in FADN reporting.

**Currency adjustment**: Same as crops (EUR -> USD using PPP, inflation-adjusted to base year)

**Usage**: Provides EU livestock production cost estimates, complementing USDA data. Costs are merged with USDA animal cost data via ``merge_animal_costs`` rule; when both sources have data for a product, values are averaged. Workflow: ``retrieve_fadn_animal_costs`` script -> ``processing/{name}/fadn_animal_costs.csv`` -> merged with USDA animal costs -> ``processing/{name}/animal_costs.csv``.

**Retrieval**: The ``retrieve_burden_of_proof`` rule (``workflow/scripts/retrieve_burden_of_proof.py``) downloads the curves automatically -- **no login required**. The Burden of Proof data endpoints sit behind a Cloudflare edge bot-check only, which a normal browser User-Agent passes from a residential/university IP (automated cloud IPs may get a 403; run the rule from a normal machine if so). The risk/cause GBD identifiers come from ``config.health.gbd_rei_id`` / ``gbd_cause_id``. ``prepare_relative_risks.py`` then converts the exposure axis to the model basis, clips each curve at the TMREL, and restores the GBD age structure (see the curated tables below).

Two companion tables under ``data/curated/health/`` are our own derived results (committed; see the model health documentation for the method):

* ``rr_age_attenuation.csv`` -- per ``(risk_factor, cause, age)`` multiplicative log-RR attenuation. The Burden of Proof tool serves only all-ages curves, so the age structure is reconstructed: the age *shape* is the GBD 2019 RR appendix (indirect; ``IHME_GBD_2019_RELATIVE_RISKS_Y2020M10D15.XLSX``), normalized to GBD's 60-64 reference age group (the median age-at-event of the cardiovascular age trend, to which GBD assigns the estimated risk curve), so the BoP "All Ages" curve is reproduced at age 60-64. Regenerated once via ``workflow/scripts/generate_rr_age_attenuation.py``.
* ``rr_tmrel.csv`` -- theoretical minimum risk exposure level per risk factor, from GBD 2023 appendix Table 18 (in GBD intake basis; converted to model basis at build time). ``red_meat`` is treated as monotonic-harmful (TMREL 0) to match its literature override.

IHME GBD 2023 -- Dietary Risk Exposure Estimates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)

**Description**: Country-level dietary risk exposure estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023, covering 15 dietary risk factors with mean exposure and uncertainty by country, age group, sex, and year. Used as the **anchor source** for risk-factor food groups (fruits, vegetables, whole_grains, legumes, nuts_seeds, red_meat) in the baseline diet, so the model's intake basis matches the basis the GBD relative-risk functions are calibrated against. GDD-IA provides the fallback when GBD lacks a country.

The 2023 release ships only per-5-year-age-bucket estimates split by sex; it does not include the ready-made "25 plus" both-sex aggregate that the 2019 release provided. ``prepare_gbd_food_group_intake.py`` therefore reconstructs the adult (25+) both-sex exposure by population-weighting the adult age buckets (using per-country age-bucket population for the reference year) and averaging the two sexes. The bulk files also contain subnational locations (US states, UK nations, Indian/Pakistani provinces, ...) whose names collide with countries, so processing restricts to national locations by ``location_id`` (taken from the GBD 2023 death-rates file) rather than by name.

**Version**: GBD 2023; two ZIP archives, each containing per-risk-factor CSVs (~90 MB each)

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: 204 countries and territories (plus subnational units, filtered out)
  * Temporal: 1990-2023, by age group and sex
  * Risk factors: Calcium, fiber, fruit, legumes, milk, nuts and seeds, omega-3 (seafood), omega-6 PUFA, processed meat, red meat, sodium, sugar-sweetened beverages, trans fat, vegetables, whole grains

.. _gdd-ia-dietary-intake:

Global Dietary Database for Impact Assessments (GDD-IA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: Marco Springmann (University College London).

**Description**: Country-level dietary intake estimates that combine
regional food availability and food-waste estimates, socio-demographic
variation in intake from dietary surveys, and energy-intake estimates
based on measurements of body weight, height and physical activity. The
result is a harmonised per-country intake dataset reported in parallel
grams/day and kcal/day for every food category. It is designed for
dietary impact assessments that need complete diets, absolute intake
levels that minimise the risk of over- or under-estimation, and regional
comparability. This is the model's default baseline-diet source
(``diet.source: gdd_ia``).

.. note::

   GDD-IA is a distinct dataset from the **Global Dietary Database
   (GDD)** of Tufts University, despite the similar name. The model does
   not use the Tufts GDD.

**Version**: Zenodo record `20818140
<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20818140>`_. The record covers 1990-2020
in five-year steps; the workflow fetches the two CSVs (grams/day and
kcal/day) for the release closest to the configured ``baseline_year``
and warns when an exact release is unavailable.

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: 171 source countries. Twelve of GLADE's 175 default
    countries are filled via configured proxies -- see
    :doc:`current_diets`.
  * Content: per-country mean dietary intake covering the major food
    groups the model represents (cereals — refined and whole-grain —
    vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, oils, sugar, legumes, poultry,
    red meat, dairy, eggs) plus out-of-scope categories (alcohol,
    seafood, spices, rendered animal fats) used only for the
    caloric-normalisation step. The dataset is stratified by age, sex
    and urban/rural residence; the pipeline consumes the all-ages,
    both-sexes, all-residences mean strata.

NHANES / FPED -- What We Eat in America
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: USDA Agricultural Research Service, Food Surveys Research Group (in partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services / CDC NHANES)

**Description**: "What We Eat in America" is the dietary intake interview component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED) translates each reported food into USDA Food Pattern equivalents (cup-eq, ounce-eq, teaspoon-eq, or grams) for 37 food-pattern components. We consume the released demographic-table summary (mean amounts of equivalents consumed per individual, by male/female and age) for the most recent prepandemic NHANES cycle and use it as an intake-based override for the United States.

**Version**: FPED 1720 -- "for use with WWEIA, NHANES 2017-March 2020 Prepandemic". Single-PDF demographic table (~160 KB), USDA ARS / FSRG, 2023 release.

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: United States only.
  * Content: Mean daily intake of fruit, vegetables, grains (whole and refined), dairy, meat / poultry / seafood / eggs / nuts and seeds, legumes, oils, solid fats, added sugars, and alcoholic drinks for the population aged 2+ (and finer male/female × age strata which we do not currently consume).

**Retrieval**: Automatic via the ``download_nhanes_fped`` rule (URL templated by FPED cycle, default ``1720``). The PDF is parsed with ``pdftotext`` (poppler) by ``prepare_nhanes_dietary_intake.py``; the column-to-food-group mapping and unit conversions live in the curated CSV ``data/curated/nhanes_fped_mapping.csv``, with conversion factors sourced from USDA MyPlate cup/ounce-equivalent definitions and the FPED Methodology and User Guide.

**Usage**: For the United States, NHANES values take precedence over both GDD intake estimates and FAOSTAT food-supply estimates in ``merge_dietary_sources.py`` for every food group it covers (fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, refined and whole grains, dairy, eggs, oils, red meat, poultry, nuts and seeds, legumes, sugar). Coverage of other intake-survey-based national datasets (e.g. CCHS for Canada, ENSANUT for Mexico) can be added in the same precedence layer.

The FPED columns are *fat-stripped decompositions* rather than food masses:
FPED Total Dairy is the low-fat / skim-equivalent fraction (butterfat is
extracted into a separate Solid Fats axis), and Meat / Poultry are reported
as lean fractions. Three projection adjustments are therefore applied to
arrive at modelled-food masses:

* **Butter top-up**: ``prepare_nhanes_dietary_intake.py`` reads FAOSTAT FBS
  Butter and Ghee (item 2740) for the configured country, applies the FAO
  dairy-commodity-tree milk-equivalent factor (21.3) and the country-level
  dairy waste fraction, and adds the result to the FPED Total Dairy value.
* **Cured meat fold**: FPED Cured Meat is added into ``red_meat`` to match
  the GDD v09 fold and keep consumption consistent with FAOSTAT
  slaughter-volume production accounting.
* **Fruit juice projection**: FPED Fruit Juice cup-equivalents are
  projected onto fresh-fruit-equivalent grams under ``fruits`` (USDA
  MyPlate counts 1 cup juice as 1 cup fruit).

All cup-, oz-, and tsp-equivalent conversion factors used in
``data/curated/nhanes_fped_mapping.csv`` are sourced row-by-row from
the FPED Methodology and User Guide
(`Bowman et al. 2020 <https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/fped/FPED_1718.pdf>`_)
Tables 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13. One factor -- the grams-per-oz-equivalent
for grains -- is an explicit modelling **assumption** rather than a
published value. FPED MUG Table 10 gives two rules: 16 g flour per
ounce-equivalent for flour-based products (bread, biscuits, pancakes,
crackers, baked goods) and 28.35 g grain per ounce-equivalent for
intact grains (rice, pasta, oats, RTE cereals). The FPED demographic
table aggregates the two product types into a single oz-eq column per
grain group without an external mix breakdown, so we apply the
unweighted midpoint (~22 g/oz-eq) as a deliberate compromise. The
trade-off is documented in the per-row note in the mapping CSV; if a
better-sourced US-mix breakdown becomes available, the factor should
be updated accordingly.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: Huang et al. (2018), HESS

**Description**: Monthly gridded (0.5 degree) sectoral water withdrawal dataset for 1971-2010, distinguishing six water use sectors. This project uses the irrigation sector data to represent current agricultural water withdrawals for validation scenarios.

**Version**: v2 (Zenodo); 7z-compressed NetCDF bundle (~296 MB). We extract the irrigation withdrawal WaterGAP file (``withd_irr_watergap.nc``).

**Coverage**:
  * Spatial: Global, 0.5 degree resolution
  * Temporal: Monthly, 1971-2010 (final year 2010 used as proxy for current irrigation)

**Access**: https://zenodo.org/records/1209296

**License**: Open access; citation requested

**Retrieval**: Retrieved via the ``download_huang_irrigation_water`` rule (Zenodo download, 7z extraction). The ``process_huang_irrigation_water`` rule aggregates gridded monthly data to model regions by area-weighted summation. Outputs: ``processing/{name}/water/current_use/monthly_region_water.csv`` and ``processing/{name}/water/current_use/region_growing_season_water.csv``, selected when ``config['water']['data']['availability']`` is ``"current_use"``.

**Usage**: Aggregated to regions for validation of water module against observed irrigation withdrawals.

Nutritional Data
----------------

USDA FoodData Central
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service

**Description**: Comprehensive food composition database providing nutritional data for foods. This project uses the SR Legacy (Standard Reference) database, which contains laboratory-analyzed nutrient data for over 7,000 foods.

**Version**: Retrieved via REST API; nutritional values per 100g of food product

**Coverage**:
  * Content: Macronutrient composition (protein, carbohydrates, total lipid/fat, energy/calories)

**Access**: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/ (web interface) or via REST API (`API documentation <https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html>`__)

**License**: Public domain under CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0). No permission needed for use, but USDA requests attribution.

**Citation**: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. FoodData Central. https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/

**Retrieval**: The build uses the pre-fetched ``data/curated/nutrition.csv``. Set ``data.usda.retrieve_nutrition: true`` to instead fetch fresh data via the ``retrieve_usda_nutrition`` rule, which requires a USDA API key.

**API Key**: Free, instant signup at https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup. Provide the key via the ``USDA_API_KEY`` environment variable or ``credentials.usda.api_key`` in ``config/secrets.yaml``; it is read only when ``retrieve_nutrition`` is enabled.

**Usage**: Nutritional composition of model foods (protein, carbohydrates, fat, energy). The mapping from model foods to USDA FoodData Central IDs is maintained in ``data/curated/usda_food_mapping.csv``.

FAO Nutrient Conversion Table for SUA (2024)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)

**Description**: Official nutrient conversion factors that align FAO Supply Utilization Account (SUA) quantities with macro- and micronutrient totals for hundreds of food items.

**Version**: 2024 Excel workbook

**Access**: https://www.fao.org/3/CC9678EN/Nutrient_conversion_table_for_SUA_2024.xlsx

**License**: (C) FAO 2024. Reuse for private study, research, teaching, or other non-commercial purposes is allowed with acknowledgement of FAO; translation, adaptation, resale, and commercial uses require prior permission via copyright@fao.org.

**Retrieval**: Automatically downloaded to ``data/downloads/fao_nutrient_conversion_table_for_sua_2024.xlsx`` by the ``download_fao_nutrient_conversion_table`` rule.

**Usage**: Contains data on edible portion of foods. ``workflow/scripts/prepare_fao_edible_portion.py`` reads sheet ``03`` to export edible portion coefficients for configured crops into ``processing/{name}/fao_edible_portion.csv``. Moisture fractions required for fresh-mass scaling live in ``data/curated/crop_moisture_content.csv`` (derived primarily from the GAEZ v5 Module VII documentation with a few documented assumptions) and are joined inside ``workflow/scripts/build_model.py``. Note that for certain crops (grains: rice, barley, oat, buckwheat; sugar crops: sugarcane, sugarbeet; oil crops: oil-palm, rapeseed), the script overrides FAO's coefficients to 1.0 so that downstream processing pathways manage the losses explicitly.

.. _redistributing-datasets:

Redistributing datasets via Zenodo
----------------------------------

Some upstream datasets are free to use but sit behind an API key or registration
wall. Where the licence permits
redistribution, GLADE mirrors the exact slice it needs to `Zenodo
<https://zenodo.org/>`__ and downloads it during builds with a plain HTTP
request. This removes the per-user credential, pins an immutable, citable
version (each Zenodo version has its own DOI and record id), and gives a single
reusable pattern for any future dataset in the same situation.

The components are:

* ``tools/zenodo_publish.py`` -- a dataset-agnostic helper that creates (or
  versions) a Zenodo deposition, uploads files, sets metadata, and publishes via
  the Zenodo REST API. Reuse it for any redistributable dataset.
* ``tools/mirror_land_cover.py`` -- the land-cover-specific maintainer tool. It
  downloads ``satellite-land-cover`` from the Copernicus CDS, extracts
  ``lccs_class``, and publishes it to Zenodo under CC-BY-4.0 with the required
  Copernicus attribution baked into the deposition metadata.
* The ``download_land_cover`` build rule, which ``curl``\ s the mirrored file
  from the record pinned by ``config['data']['land_cover']['zenodo_record']``.

**Before mirroring a new dataset**, confirm its licence actually permits
redistribution (CC-BY / CC0 / public domain are safe; "use only" or
non-commercial-no-redistribution terms are not) and record the required
attribution in the deposition metadata.

**Refreshing the land cover mirror** (maintainer, requires a Copernicus CDS
token and a Zenodo token -- see ``config/secrets.yaml.example``)::

    # Optional dry-run against the Zenodo sandbox (leaves an unpublished draft):
    pixi run -e dev python tools/mirror_land_cover.py --sandbox --no-publish

    # First publication (creates a new Zenodo record):
    pixi run -e dev python tools/mirror_land_cover.py

    # New data version (publishes a new version of an existing record):
    pixi run -e dev python tools/mirror_land_cover.py --parent-record <record-id>

The tool prints the published record id; set it as
``config['data']['land_cover']['zenodo_record']`` in ``config/default.yaml`` and
commit that change so builds pick up the new mirror.
