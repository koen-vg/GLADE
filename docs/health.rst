Health Impacts
==============

This chapter describes how the model quantifies the health consequences of
dietary choices. It begins with the epidemiological concepts that underpin the
methodology, then explains the implementation strategy for embedding these
nonlinear relationships into a linear optimisation framework.

.. admonition:: The health module is off by default
   :class: note

   ``health.enabled`` defaults to ``false``. WHO GHE mortality is retrieved
   automatically by default. GBD dietary risk-exposure remains a manual input
   when baseline-diet anchoring is enabled; see :doc:`data_sources`. When
   health and anchoring are disabled, no manual health input is required and
   the workflow builds, solves, and analyses without it -- the
   YLL stores, health objective term, and health analysis/plots are
   simply omitted, and a clear error is raised if the data is missing
   while health is on.

   Enabling health also turns on **GBD anchoring of the baseline diet**
   by default (``diet.anchor_groups_to_gbd: match_health``), so that the
   model's attributable-burden numbers share the GBD intake basis. That
   anchoring changes the baseline diet and is an independent switch -- see
   :ref:`current-diets-gbd-anchoring`. Because the baseline diet feeds the
   calibration, a run must consume the artefact set matching its resolved
   anchoring: ``calibration.source: default`` (anchoring off) or
   ``gbd-anchored`` (anchoring on); see :doc:`calibration`.

Conceptual Framework
--------------------

The health module converts dietary intake patterns into monetised health costs
using epidemiological dose–response relationships from the `Global Burden of
Disease (GBD) Study <https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/gbd>`_. This
section explains the key concepts and formulas.

Relative Risk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a given disease :math:`d` (e.g., coronary heart disease) and dietary risk
factor (e.g., vegetable intake), the **relative risk** :math:`\mathrm{RR}_d(x)`
quantifies how the probability of developing that disease changes with intake
level :math:`x`. Specifically, :math:`\mathrm{RR}_d(x)` is the ratio of disease
probability at intake :math:`x` to the probability at some reference intake.

.. admonition:: Example

   From GBD data, vegetables and CHD: :math:`\mathrm{RR}_{\mathrm{CHD}}(0) = 1.0`,
   :math:`\mathrm{RR}_{\mathrm{CHD}}(100\text{g}) = 0.91`,
   :math:`\mathrm{RR}_{\mathrm{CHD}}(300\text{g}) = 0.80`.
   Consuming 300g/day of vegetables reduces CHD risk by 20% compared to zero intake.

For **protective foods** (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, etc.), RR decreases
as intake increases. For **harmful foods** (red meat, processed meat), RR
increases with intake.

Theoretical Minimum Risk Exposure Level (TMREL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **TMREL**, denoted :math:`\bar{x}`, is the counterfactual minimum-risk
intake. We define:

.. math::
   \mathrm{RR}_d^{\mathrm{ref}} = \mathrm{RR}_d(\bar{x})

as the reference relative risk at optimal intake. TMREL values are taken
directly from the GBD 2023 appendix (curated ``rr_tmrel.csv``), not derived
from the curves: for protective foods it is a high real-world intake (e.g.
fruits 340-350 g/day), and for harmful foods it is typically zero. Each RR
curve is **clipped at its TMREL** so that intake beyond the TMREL yields no
further benefit (protective) and intake below it none (harmful). This keeps
the health cost non-negative and bounded, and avoids crediting implausibly
high intakes.

Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **population attributable fraction** measures how much of the disease burden
would change if intake shifted from a baseline level :math:`x^{\mathrm{base}}`
to a new level :math:`x`. It is defined as:

.. math::
   \mathrm{PAF}_d(x) = 1 - \frac{\mathrm{RR}_d(x)}{\mathrm{RR}_d(x^{\mathrm{base}})}

Interpretation:

- :math:`\mathrm{PAF}_d(x) > 0`: intake :math:`x` is healthier than baseline
  (disease burden decreases)
- :math:`\mathrm{PAF}_d(x) < 0`: intake :math:`x` is less healthy than baseline
  (disease burden increases)
- :math:`\mathrm{PAF}_d(\bar{x})` is the fraction of burden avoidable by shifting
  to optimal intake

.. admonition:: Example

   Suppose baseline vegetable intake is 150g/day with
   :math:`\mathrm{RR}_{\mathrm{CHD}}(150) = 0.87`, and we consider shifting to
   300g/day with :math:`\mathrm{RR}_{\mathrm{CHD}}(300) = 0.80`. Then:

   .. math::
      \mathrm{PAF}_{\mathrm{CHD}}(300) = 1 - \frac{0.80}{0.87} \approx 0.08

   An 8% reduction in CHD burden is attributable to this dietary shift.

Years of Life Lost (YLL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Years of life lost** quantifies premature mortality by multiplying deaths by
remaining life expectancy. Let :math:`\mathrm{YLL}_d` denote the observed
baseline YLL for disease :math:`d` in a population.

When intake changes from baseline :math:`x^{\mathrm{base}}` to :math:`x`, the
change in YLL is:

.. math::
   \Delta\mathrm{YLL}_d = \mathrm{PAF}_d(x) \times \mathrm{YLL}_d

.. admonition:: Example

   A population loses 50,000 years of life annually to CHD
   (:math:`\mathrm{YLL}_{\mathrm{CHD}} = 50{,}000`). If a dietary intervention
   achieves :math:`\mathrm{PAF}_{\mathrm{CHD}} = 0.08`, then:

   .. math::
      \Delta\mathrm{YLL}_{\mathrm{CHD}} = 0.08 \times 50{,}000 = 4{,}000 \text{ YLL avoided}

Multiple Risk Factors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When multiple dietary risk factors affect the same disease :math:`d`, their
effects combine **multiplicatively**:

.. math::
   \mathrm{RR}_d = \prod_{r} \mathrm{RR}_{r,d}(x_r)

where :math:`r` indexes risk factors and :math:`x_r` is the intake for each.

.. admonition:: Example

   CHD is affected by both vegetables (:math:`\mathrm{RR}_{v,\mathrm{CHD}} = 0.80`)
   and red meat (:math:`\mathrm{RR}_{m,\mathrm{CHD}} = 1.15`). The combined effect:

   .. math::
      \mathrm{RR}_{\mathrm{CHD}} = 0.80 \times 1.15 = 0.92

   Net 8% reduction in CHD risk despite increased red meat consumption.

.. _age-specific-rr:

Age-Specific Relative Risk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relative risk for cardiovascular outcomes (CHD, Stroke) **attenuates with
age**: the protective or harmful effect of dietary risk factors weakens in
older age groups. T2DM and CRC have identical RR across all age groups.

The Burden of Proof tool serves only age-aggregated ("All Ages") curves, so
the age structure is reconstructed. The attenuation is multiplicative in
log-RR and essentially exposure-independent, so each all-ages curve is
expanded as :math:`\mathrm{RR}_{a}(x) = \exp(\beta_{a} \cdot \log
\mathrm{RR}(x))`, with the per-(cause, age) factor :math:`\beta_a` taken from
the curated ``rr_age_attenuation.csv`` (age shape from the GBD 2019 RR
appendix, normalized to GBD's 60-64 reference age group -- the age to which
GBD assigns the estimated risk curve, so the BoP "All Ages" curve is the RR at
60-64; :math:`\beta = 1` for T2DM and CRC).

Since most years of life lost (YLL) from cardiovascular diseases come from
older age groups, using the youngest age group's RR would systematically
overestimate health impacts. The model therefore computes **YLL-weighted
effective RR curves** for each health cluster.

For each cluster :math:`c`, cause :math:`d`, and risk factor :math:`r`, the
effective relative risk at intake :math:`x` is:

.. math::
   \mathrm{RR}^{\mathrm{eff}}_{c,r,d}(x) = \sum_a w_{a,c,d} \cdot \mathrm{RR}_{a,r,d}(x)

where :math:`w_{a,c,d} = \mathrm{YLL}_{a,c,d} / \sum_{a'} \mathrm{YLL}_{a',c,d}`
are YLL-based age weights computed from age-specific mortality, population, and
life expectancy data.

This approach is **exact for causes with a single risk factor** and a good
approximation for causes with multiple risk factors (the approximation error
is second-order, proportional to the covariance of age-specific RR curves
across risk factors).

Health Cost Formulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In GLADE, we define the health cost as the monetised value of years
of life lost that could have been avoided by eating optimally. For a
population cluster :math:`c` and disease :math:`d`:

.. math::
   \mathrm{Cost}_{c,d}(x) = V \times \left(
   \Delta\mathrm{YLL}_d(\bar{x}) - \Delta\mathrm{YLL}_d(x)
   \right)

where :math:`V` is the value per year of life lost (configured as
``health.value_per_yll``, default 50,000 USD). The term
:math:`\Delta\mathrm{YLL}_d(\bar{x})` is the maximum YLL avoidable (at optimal
intake), while :math:`\Delta\mathrm{YLL}_d(x)` is the YLL actually avoided at
intake :math:`x`. The difference is the YLL that *could have been* avoided but
wasn't—the health cost of not eating optimally.

To get an implementation-friendly formula using relative risk factors directly, we can expand a simplify using :math:`\Delta\mathrm{YLL}_d(x) = \mathrm{PAF}_d(x) \times \mathrm{YLL}_{c,d}` and the above formula for :math:`\mathrm{PAF_d}`:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   \Delta\mathrm{YLL}_d(\bar{x}) - \Delta\mathrm{YLL}_d(x)
   &= \mathrm{YLL}_{c,d} \times \left[ \mathrm{PAF}_d(\bar{x}) - \mathrm{PAF}_d(x) \right] \\
   &= \mathrm{YLL}_{c,d} \times \left[
      \left(1 - \frac{\mathrm{RR}_d(\bar{x})}{\mathrm{RR}_d(x^{\mathrm{base}})}\right)
      - \left(1 - \frac{\mathrm{RR}_d(x)}{\mathrm{RR}_d(x^{\mathrm{base}})}\right)
   \right] \\
   &= \frac{\mathrm{YLL}_{c,d}}{\mathrm{RR}_d(x^{\mathrm{base}})}
      \times \left( \mathrm{RR}_d(x) - \mathrm{RR}_d^{\mathrm{ref}} \right)
   \end{aligned}

This gives the final formula:

.. math::
   \mathrm{Cost}_{c,d}(x) = V \times
   \frac{\mathrm{YLL}_{c,d}}{\mathrm{RR}_d(x^{\mathrm{base}})}
   \times \left( \mathrm{RR}_d(x) - \mathrm{RR}_d^{\mathrm{ref}} \right)

**Key properties:**

1. **Zero cost at TMREL**: When :math:`x = \bar{x}`, the cost is zero because
   we avoid as many years of life lost as possible.

2. **Non-negative costs**: Since TMREL minimises RR, we have
   :math:`\mathrm{RR}_d(x) \geq \mathrm{RR}_d^{\mathrm{ref}}` always.

.. admonition:: Example

   Consider a cluster with:

   - :math:`\mathrm{YLL}_{\mathrm{CHD}} = 100{,}000` years (observed CHD burden)
   - :math:`\mathrm{RR}_{\mathrm{CHD}}(x^{\mathrm{base}}) = 1.10` (baseline diet slightly unhealthy)
   - :math:`\mathrm{RR}_{\mathrm{CHD}}^{\mathrm{ref}} = 0.85` (at TMREL)
   - :math:`\mathrm{RR}_{\mathrm{CHD}}(x) = 0.95` (optimised diet, not quite optimal)
   - :math:`V = 50{,}000` USD/YLL

   .. math::
      \mathrm{Cost} = 50{,}000 \times \frac{100{,}000}{1.10} \times (0.95 - 0.85)
      \approx 50{,}000 \times 90{,}909 \times 0.10 \approx 455 \text{ million USD}

   The health cost is approximately 455 million USD for this cluster–disease pair.

GBD Dietary Risk Factors
------------------------

The model uses dietary risk factor definitions from the Global Burden
of Disease Study 2021 [Brauer2024]_. The following table reproduces a
subset of these definitions from Brauer et al. (2024, Supplementary
Appendix 1, p. 171).

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 40 35

   * - Risk Factor
     - Definition of Exposure
     - Optimal Level (TMREL)
   * - Diet low in fruit
     - Average daily consumption of fruit including fresh, frozen, cooked,
       canned, or dried fruit, excluding fruit juices and salted or pickled
       fruits
     - 340–350 g/day
   * - Diet low in vegetables
     - Average daily consumption of vegetables, including fresh, frozen, cooked,
       canned, or dried vegetables, excluding legumes, salted or pickled
       vegetables, juices, nuts and seeds, and starchy vegetables
     - 306–372 g/day
   * - Diet low in whole grains
     - Average daily consumption of whole grains (bran, germ, and endosperm in
       natural proportion) from cereals, bread, rice, pasta, etc.
     - 160–210 g/day
   * - Diet low in nuts and seeds
     - Average daily consumption of nuts and seeds, including tree nuts, seeds,
       and peanuts
     - 19–24 g/day
   * - Diet low in legumes
     - Average daily consumption of legumes and pulses, including fresh, frozen,
       cooked, canned, or dried legumes
     - 100–110 g/day
   * - Diet low in seafood omega-3
     - Average daily consumption of EPA and DHA (mg/day)
     - 470–660 mg/day
   * - Diet high in red meat
     - Average daily consumption of unprocessed red meat (beef, pork, lamb,
       goat), excluding processed meats, poultry, fish, and eggs
     - 0–200 g/day
   * - Diet high in processed meat
     - Average daily consumption of meat preserved by smoking, curing, salting,
       or chemical preservatives
     - 0 g/day

**Notes on current implementation:**

- **Risk factors modelled by default**: fruits, vegetables, whole_grains,
  nuts_seeds, legumes, red_meat (configured in ``health.risk_factors``).
  GBD also provides seafood omega-3 and processed meat risk factors, but
  fish/seafood and processed meat are not currently modelled as separate
  food groups.
- **Processed meat in red_meat**: GDD-IA's processed/"other" red-meat
  category (``othr_meat``) is folded into the ``red_meat`` exposure used
  by the health module so that consumption mass stays consistent with
  FAOSTAT slaughter-volume animal production (see :doc:`current_diets`).
  Because GBD's red-meat exposure-response curve was calibrated against
  unprocessed red meat intake levels, the resulting risk attribution is
  a slight conservative approximation: the higher per-gram carcinogenic
  risk that GBD assigns specifically to processed meat is not
  reproduced. A future improvement would be to add ``prc_meat`` as a
  real food group with its own RR; in the current model this trade-off
  is preferred over silently dropping the processed-meat mass, since
  closing the consumption-vs-production leak matters for emissions
  accounting.
- **Disease causes modelled**: CHD (coronary heart disease), Stroke, T2DM (type
  2 diabetes), CRC (colorectal cancer)
- **Diabetes cause scope**: The relative-risk curves represent type 2 diabetes,
  while both supported mortality inputs expose broad diabetes mellitus in the
  mortality preparation used here. The current implementation therefore uses
  broad diabetes mortality as the T2DM baseline burden. Alternatives would be
  to estimate type 2 shares by country and age from another source, redefine
  the health pathway around broad diabetes with matching relative risks, or
  retain IHME mortality only for diabetes. Each adds either a new assumption,
  a new epidemiological input, or the manual download that WHO GHE is intended
  to remove.
- **Sugar**: The GBD dataset includes relative risk factors for
  sugar-sweetened beverages, which are not represented in the model
  and thus not included here. No relative risk factors are given for
  total added sugar intake.
- **TMREL values**: Taken from the GBD 2023 appendix (curated ``rr_tmrel.csv``),
  used to clip the curves (see :ref:`tmrel-derivation`)
- **Age range**: Risk factors evaluated for adults >=25 years
  (``health.intake_age_min``). The all-ages BoP curves are expanded to all
  15 adult age groups (25-29 through 95+) via the curated age-attenuation
  table and combined into YLL-weighted effective RR curves per health
  cluster (see :ref:`age-specific-rr`).
- **Intake units**: Per-group basis matches the baseline-diet pipeline
  output (model basis; see :doc:`current_diets`). GBD exposure is
  converted to that basis at load time via ``diet.source_basis`` and
  ``diet.weight_conversion``.
- **Alternative RR sources**: The ``health.alternative_rr`` config option allows
  substituting GBD dose-response curves with log-linear curves from literature
  meta-analyses on a per-risk-factor basis. By default, red meat uses literature
  estimates (Bechthold et al. 2019 for CHD/Stroke, Li et al. 2024 for T2DM,
  Chan et al. 2011 for CRC) with the curated age-attenuation factors applied. The
  log-linear assumption means ``RR(x) = RR_{per\,unit}^{x/unit}``. Confidence
  intervals propagate through the GSA quantile architecture via ``log_rr_low``
  and ``log_rr_high`` columns in the breakpoint tables.

.. _tmrel-derivation:

TMREL and Curve Clipping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TMREL values are taken from the GBD 2023 appendix (Table 18) and stored in the
curated ``rr_tmrel.csv`` (GBD intake basis; converted to model basis at build
time, alongside the per-risk ``tmrel.csv`` consumed downstream). Each
``(risk_factor, cause)`` curve is then **clipped at its TMREL**: for protective
risks the curve is truncated at the TMREL so intake beyond it gives no further
benefit; for harmful risks it is truncated below the TMREL. Because the
reference :math:`\mathrm{RR}_d^{\mathrm{ref}} = \mathrm{RR}_d(\bar{x})` is the
plateau value, the modelled health cost is non-negative everywhere and zero on
the no-burden side of the TMREL, so the optimiser is never rewarded for
pushing intake to implausible levels.

Implementation Strategy
-----------------------

Embedding the health cost formulation into a linear programme requires careful
handling of nonlinearities. This section provides a high-level overview of the
implementation approach.

Linearizing multiplicative risk factors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core challenge is that relative risks **multiply** across risk factors :math:`r`:

.. math::
   \mathrm{RR}_d = \prod_{r} \mathrm{RR}_{r,d}(x_r)

This product is nonlinear in the intake variables :math:`x_r`. This is
a problem since GLADE is nominally formulated as a *linear*
optimization model. Non-linear constraints such as the above cannot
directly be incorporated into the overall linear program formulation,
and generally make the optimization program more difficult to solve
both theoretically and practically speaking.

In order to still incorporate the multiplicative factors, we convert
multiplication to a logarithm + addition + exponential, and use
piecewise-linear approximations of the logarithmic and exponential
functions.

1. Convert multiplication to addition: :math:`\log(\prod_r \mathrm{RR}_{r,d}) = \sum_r \log(\mathrm{RR}_{r,d})`
2. Approximate :math:`\log(\mathrm{RR}_{r,d}(x_r))` as a piecewise-linear function of :math:`x_r`
3. Approximate :math:`\exp(z)` as a piecewise-linear function to recover :math:`\mathrm{RR}_d`

Two-Stage SOS2 Interpolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The implementation uses **Special Ordered Sets of Type 2 (SOS2)** constraints to
represent piecewise-linear functions without introducing binary variables (when
the solver supports SOS2).

**Stage 1: Intake → log(RR)**

For each risk factor :math:`r` and disease :math:`d`, precompute breakpoints
:math:`(x_k, \log\mathrm{RR}_{r,d}(x_k))` from the GBD dose–response data. During
optimisation, introduce SOS2 variables :math:`\lambda_k` satisfying:

.. math::
   \sum_k \lambda_k = 1, \quad
   x_r = \sum_k x_k \lambda_k, \quad
   \log\mathrm{RR}_{r,d} = \sum_k \lambda_k \log\mathrm{RR}_{r,d}(x_k)

The SOS2 constraint ensures at most two adjacent :math:`\lambda_k` are nonzero,
yielding piecewise-linear interpolation.

**Stage 2: Aggregated log(RR) → RR**

Sum the log-RR contributions across risk factors:
:math:`z_d = \sum_r \log\mathrm{RR}_{r,d}`. Then apply a second SOS2 interpolation
using precomputed breakpoints :math:`(z_m, \exp(z_m))` to recover :math:`\mathrm{RR}_d`.

Health Clustering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modelling health impacts for each country individually would create an
intractable number of variables and constraints. Instead, countries are grouped
into **health clusters** that share:

- Similar geographic location
- Similar GDP per capita (proxy for healthcare quality)
- Roughly balanced population sizes

The clustering algorithm uses weighted K-means with iterative refinement. The
number of clusters is configured via ``health.region_clusters``.

   capita similarity, and population balance.

   Baseline diet-attributable chronic disease burden (years of life lost per
   100,000 population) by health cluster, computed from Global Burden of Disease
   data. Clusters with higher burden tend to have diets with greater exposure to
   dietary risk factors such as low fruit and vegetable intake or high red meat
   consumption.

Solver Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stage 1 uses a single delta (incremental) formulation for all solvers, and
adds integer structure only where a curve actually needs it:

- **Convex curves** (in the objective-relevant direction): the delta fill-up
  LP relaxation is already exact, because the health objective is monotone
  increasing in every log(RR) and so the LP fills the steepest-benefit
  segments first on its own. No integer variables are added. Harmful risk
  factors with a de-plateaued (linear) curve and protective curves with
  diminishing returns fall here.

- **Non-convex (S-shaped) curves**: SOS1 segment indicators plus delta-y
  linking constraints forbid the LP from interpolating across the convex hull
  (which would under-count risk). On solvers without native SOS (e.g. HiGHS),
  linopy reformulates the SOS1 sets to binary + Big-M.

The convex/non-convex split is decided per (cluster, risk) pair, which keeps
the Stage 1 MILP as small as the dose-response data allows.

Relax-and-Fix Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``health.segment_formulation: relax_and_fix`` (the default) replaces the
SOS1 indicators with a two-pass LP scheme, so the model contains no integer
variables at all:

1. Solve the model without segment indicators. This is a relaxation: on
   non-convex curves the delta variables may interpolate across the convex
   hull, so the objective is a valid bound on the exact-MIP optimum.
2. For each non-convex (cluster, risk) pair, compute the relaxed intake and
   pin the delta bounds to the fill-up pattern of the segment containing it
   (only the active segment's delta stays free).
3. Re-solve. The bound changes repair quickly from the pass-1 basis, and the
   solution now lies exactly on the piecewise dose-response curve.

The relative difference between the two objectives is a certified optimality
gap, checked against ``health.relax_and_fix_max_gap``. If the check fails,
the solve first re-fixes the segments from the repaired solution (intakes
pressing against a pinned segment boundary select the neighbouring segment)
and, if the gap still exceeds the tolerance, automatically falls back to the
exact SOS1 MIP on the same model, seeded with the repaired solution as MIP
start -- so a failed certificate costs extra solve time rather than an
error. On the full-resolution model the certified gap is well within the
0.1% MIP tolerance used with ``sos1``, results agree across solvers, and the
solve is faster than the MIP even under Gurobi. Higher values per YLL
tighten rather than widen the gap: they push intakes to breakpoint corners,
where the relaxation is exact.

Because the scheme contains no integer variables it works with any LP
solver. With HiGHS, pair it with
``solving.options_highs: {solver: ipm, run_crossover: on}`` so the relaxation
is solved by the interior-point method (the crossover basis warm-starts the
repair pass); HiGHS's default simplex does not terminate on full-resolution
models. See :doc:`configuration` for the solver options.

Delta Formulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For n breakpoints
:math:`(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1})` with function values
:math:`(f_0, f_1, \ldots, f_{n-1})`:

**Variables**: δ_j ∈ [0,1] for j = 0, ..., n-2 (one per segment)

**Constraints**:

.. math::

   \delta_j \leq \delta_{j-1} \quad \text{for } j \geq 1 \quad \text{(fill-up ordering)}

   x = x_0 + \sum_j \delta_j \cdot \Delta x_j \quad \text{(input interpolation)}

   f(x) = f_0 + \sum_j \delta_j \cdot \Delta f_j \quad \text{(output interpolation)}

where :math:`\Delta x_j = x_{j+1} - x_j` and :math:`\Delta f_j = f_{j+1} - f_j`.

**Why it works**: The fill-up constraints ensure segments are "filled" from left
to right. For a convex curve this is exactly the LP optimum (minimising
:math:`\sum_j \delta_j \Delta f_j` for a fixed input fills segments in
increasing slope order, which equals left-to-right order iff the slopes are
non-decreasing). For a non-convex curve the SOS1 indicators are needed to pin
the single fractional segment.

Data Flow Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Preprocessing** (``workflow/scripts/prepare_health_costs.py``):

1. Cluster countries into health regions
2. Compute baseline YLL and RR for each cluster–cause pair
3. Build breakpoint tables for SOS2 interpolation
4. Output: ``risk_breakpoints.csv``, ``cause_log_breakpoints.csv``,
   ``cluster_cause_baseline.csv``

**Solver** (``workflow/scripts/solve_model.py``):

1. Read breakpoint tables
2. Create SOS2 variables and constraints for each cluster–risk–cause combination
3. Construct health cost expressions and add to objective

Detailed Implementation
-----------------------

This section provides technical details for developers working with the health
module.

Data Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~

``workflow/scripts/prepare_health_costs.py`` assembles the following datasets:

``health.mortality_source`` is a structural base-config option and cannot be
changed by a scenario override.

- **Baseline diet** (``processing/{name}/dietary_intake.csv``): average
  daily food-group intake by country, merged from GDD-IA and NHANES
  (USA) — see :doc:`current_diets`. The per-food disaggregation lives
  in ``processing/{name}/baseline_diet.csv``.
- **Relative risks** (``processing/{name}/health/relative_risks.csv``):
  dose–response pairs for each (risk factor, cause) combination from GBD
- **Mortality rates** (``processing/{name}/health/who_ghe_mortality_rates.csv``
  by default): cause-specific death rates by age, country and year. The IHME
  alternative is ``gbd_mortality_rates.csv``. WHO provides only an aggregate
  85+ rate; applying it to the model's three oldest age bands preserves total
  deaths over 85+ but approximates their YLL and relative-risk age weights.
- **Population and life tables** (``processing/{name}/population_age.csv`` and
  ``processing/{name}/health/life_table.csv``): age-structured population counts
  and remaining life expectancy schedules

Preparation Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preprocessing script performs these steps:

1. **Health clustering** – groups countries into ``health.region_clusters``
   clusters using a multi-objective approach that balances:

   - **Geographic proximity** (weight: ``health.clustering.weights.geography``)
   - **GDP per capita similarity** (weight: ``health.clustering.weights.gdp``)
   - **Population balance** (weight: ``health.clustering.weights.population``)

   The cluster map is saved as ``processing/{name}/health/country_clusters.csv``.

2. **Baseline burden** – combines mortality, population and life expectancy to
   compute years of life lost (YLL) per cluster. For each cause, it computes
   both total YLL and diet-attributable YLL using the population-attributable
   fraction. Results: ``processing/{name}/health/cluster_cause_baseline.csv``.

3. **TMREL derivation** – finds the intake that minimises aggregate log(RR) for
   each risk factor. Results: ``processing/{name}/health/derived_tmrel.csv``.

4. **Risk-factor breakpoints** – builds per-risk intake grids and evaluates
   :math:`\log(\mathrm{RR})` at each knot. The grid domain runs from 0 to the
   larger of the empirical RR range and the per-capita consumption cap
   (``food_groups.max_per_capita``, itself the store ``e_nom_max``); capping at
   the consumption limit rather than a uniform generous value avoids a flat
   extrapolation plateau beyond the data, which would otherwise add a spurious
   concave kink for harmful (increasing) risk factors. Starting from the native
   (smooth) BoP exposure points, a Douglas-Peucker pass keeps the smallest knot
   set reproducing every (cluster, cause) curve -- including the low/high
   uncertainty bounds -- to within ``health.breakpoint_rel_tol`` of each curve's
   amplitude (default 5%). Results:
   ``processing/{name}/health/risk_breakpoints.csv``.

5. **Cause-level breakpoints** – constructs breakpoints for the aggregated
   log-RR and its exponential. Results:
   ``processing/{name}/health/cause_log_breakpoints.csv``.

From Diet to Risk Exposure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Per-capita intake**

During optimisation, consumption is tracked using food group stores named
``store_<group>_<ISO3>``. For each health cluster :math:`c` and risk factor
:math:`r`, the solver computes per-capita intake by summing store levels across
countries in the cluster:

.. math::
   I_{c,r} = \frac{10^{12}}{365\,P_c} \sum_{i \in c} e_{i,r}

where :math:`e_{i,r}` is the store level for country :math:`i` and food group
:math:`r` in Mt/year, and :math:`P_c` is the cluster population. The factor
:math:`10^{12}` converts from megatonnes to grams.

**Linearised relative risk curves**

For every (cluster, risk) pair, SOS2 variables :math:`\lambda_k` satisfy:

.. math::
   \sum_k \lambda_k = 1, \quad
   I_{c,r} = \sum_k x_k \lambda_k, \quad
   \log\mathrm{RR}_{c,r,d} = \sum_k \lambda_k \log\mathrm{RR}_{r,d}(x_k)

**Aggregating across risk factors**

The combined effect on each disease is:

.. math::
   \log\mathrm{RR}_{c,d} = \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}_d} \log\mathrm{RR}_{c,r,d}

**Recovering total relative risk**

A second SOS2 interpolation maps :math:`z = \log\mathrm{RR}_{c,d}` back to
:math:`\mathrm{RR}_{c,d} = \exp(z)` using precomputed breakpoints.

**Health cost expression**

The PyPSA store energy level encodes deviation from optimal:

.. math::
   e_{c,d} = \left(\mathrm{RR}_d(x) - \mathrm{RR}_d^{\mathrm{ref}}\right)
   \cdot \frac{\mathrm{YLL}_{c,d}}{\mathrm{RR}_d(x^{\mathrm{base}})}
   \cdot 10^{-6}

measured in million YLL. The monetary contribution is
``marginal_cost_storage × e``.

Configuration
-------------

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: health ---
   :end-before: # --- section: aggregation ---

Key parameters:

- ``region_clusters``: Number of health clusters (more = finer resolution, slower)
- ``breakpoint_rel_tol``: Stage 1 PWL accuracy as a fraction of each RR curve's amplitude (default 5%)
- ``log_rr_points``: Density of Stage 2 breakpoints
- ``value_per_yll``: Monetary value per year of life lost (USD)
- ``risk_factors``: Which dietary risk factors to model
- ``risk_cause_map``: Which causes each risk factor affects

Outputs
-------

The preprocessing rule saves all intermediate products under
``processing/{name}/health/``:

- ``country_clusters.csv``: Cluster assignments
- ``cluster_cause_baseline.csv``: Baseline YLL and RR by cluster–cause
- ``cluster_summary.csv``: Cluster populations
- ``risk_breakpoints.csv``: Stage 1 breakpoint tables
- ``cause_log_breakpoints.csv``: Stage 2 breakpoint tables
- ``derived_tmrel.csv``: TMREL values derived from RR curves

Plotting rules create visualisations under ``results/{name}/plots/``.
