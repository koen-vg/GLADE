"""Iterative calibration of L1 deviation-penalty coefficients.

Drives the per-component deviation percentages (any non-empty subset of
{cropland, grassland, feed, diet}) simultaneously to the target percentage via Broyden's
method in log-log coordinates. Each iteration is one paired baseline+main
solve, run in-process by the script.
