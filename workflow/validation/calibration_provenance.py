"""Provenance tracking for calibration artefact sets.

Each artefact set under ``data/curated/calibration/<source>/`` carries a
``provenance.yaml`` recording the structural configuration it was
calibrated against (written by ``tools/calibrate`` via
``workflow/scripts/write_calibration_provenance.py``). At workflow start
the active config is compared against the stamp of the set it consumes
(``calibration.source``); a mismatch means the artefacts were fit under
different structural assumptions and are not valid for this config.

The comparison covers all *structural* config leaves: solve-time keys
(SOLVE_TIME_CONFIG_PREFIXES) never invalidate calibration, and a small
set of additional prefixes is exempted below because it describes run
identity or calibration machinery rather than what the artefacts were
fit to.
