GLADE (**G**lobal **L**and, **A**griculture, **D**iet and **E**missions) is a global food-systems optimization model built on [PyPSA](https://pypsa.org/) and [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io). It explores environmental, nutritional, and economic trade-offs through a configuration-driven mixed integer linear program built around a reproducible workflow.

## Documentation

Full documentation (model design, configuration reference, data provenance, API) is published at <https://sustainable-solutions-lab.github.io/GLADE/>. There, you can also find more information on installation as well as download tutorial Jupyter notebooks to learn more about how to run GLADE and analyze results.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) (cross-platform package manager)
2. Ensure at least ~20 GB of free disk space for datasets, software dependencies and intermediate results.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sustainable-Solutions-Lab/GLADE.git
cd GLADE
pixi install
```

### Setup

Health-enabled configs anchor the baseline diet to IHME GBD dietary-exposure
data by default; those two archives require registration and manual download.
See the [Data Sources documentation](https://sustainable-solutions-lab.github.io/GLADE/data_sources.html#manual-download-checklist) for instructions. A manual mortality export is needed only when selecting `health.mortality_source: ihme_gbd`.

A free USDA FoodData Central key is needed only to refresh nutritional data (`data.usda.retrieve_nutrition: true`); see [`config/secrets.yaml.example`](config/secrets.yaml.example).

### Run the model

```bash
tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/validation.yaml
```

The first run downloads several gigabytes of global datasets (GAEZ, GADM, land cover, etc.) and may take 30+ minutes. Once the data downloading and preprocessing steps are complete, subsequent model runs are relatively fast. Building and solving a typical model instance at default resolution will typically take only a few minutes and require about 3 GB of RAM.

### Solver options

The default environment uses the HiGHS open-source solver. For faster solving with Gurobi (requires license):

```bash
pixi install --environment gurobi
tools/smk -e gurobi -j4 --configfile config/validation.yaml
```

### Notes

- `tools/smk` wraps Snakemake with memory limits and environment configuration
- By default, results are saved under `results/{config_name}/` (path roots can be overridden via `config.paths`)
- The workflow validates configuration and data before running

## Repository Layout

- `workflow/` – Snakemake rules and scripts, including the top-level `workflow/Snakefile`.
- `config/` – Scenario YAMLs and shared fragments that parameterize the workflow.
- `docs/` – Sphinx documentation sources (see `docs/README.md` for dev tips).
- `tools/` – Helper wrappers such as `tools/smk` for consistent CLI entry points.
- `results/` – Generated artifacts grouped by configuration (never hand-edit).

Additional contribution guidance can be found in the documentation; dataset provenance is tracked in `docs/data_sources.rst`.
